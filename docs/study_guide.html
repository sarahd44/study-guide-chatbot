<h1>Product Characteristics</h1>

<p>Ted Levitt, a notable marketer, once said, "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want to buy a quarter-inch hole." The point Levitt was making is that customers don't buy a product because of its <em>features</em>; they buy a product as a collection of desired <em>benefits</em>.</p>

<p>For example, Dr. Cooke mentioned that students buy textbooks to do well in the class and ultimately to learn about marketing. He also stated that students buy Smokin'Notes to supplement their learning and minimize <em>anticipated regret</em> after the exam; ultimately, students who buy Smokin'Notes want peace of mind knowing that they did everything they could do in trying to do well on their exams.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong> refer to those aspects that are built into a product. They don't mean much to consumers in isolation. <strong>Benefits</strong> refer to what the product does and what people get out of it. People buy products for the benefits that the products deliver. Features primarily matter insofar as they provide benefits to the customer. Accordingly, marketers should focus on emphasizing benefits rather than features when selling their products.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Features vs. Benefits</h4>
<p>Consumers buy products for the value they provide (benefits) rather than their built-in attributes (features).</p>
</div>

<p>For example, consider how the following features for various products can be linked to benefits:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Benefit</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>This <em>razor</em> has a triple-action cutting system.</td>
<td>You can get a smooth shave using this <em>razor</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>Greek yogurt</em> is full of nutrients including protein.</td>
<td>Consuming <em>Greek yogurt</em> is healthy and will satisfy you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>These <em>tissues</em> have a velvety texture and multiple cushiony layers.</td>
<td>These <em>tissues</em> will be soothing for your nose and make your cold as luxurious as possible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Each dose of this <em>medicine</em> contains 500mg of acetaminophen.</td>
<td>One dose of this <em>medicine</em> will relieve headache pain so you can enjoy your day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This <em>computer</em> has a 3GHz quad-core processor and 8GB of RAM.</td>
<td>You will be able to play and work at lightning speed when using this <em>computer</em>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This <em>phone case</em> was made with layers of carbon fibers and contains reinforced plastic.</td>
<td>This <em>phone case</em> will protect your phone from breaking if it is dropped.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>A problem with an obsessive focus on features is called <strong>creeping featurism</strong> (or <strong>featuritis</strong>)—the tendency to simply add features to a product without thinking about how they relate to the benefits for users. Adding features can be detrimental if they interfere with or detract from the product's core or expected benefits. The <strong>featuritis curve</strong> shows how increasing the number of features initially increases user happiness, but at a certain point (the "happy user peak"), adding features begins to decrease user happiness because the product gets more complicated to use.</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-01-featuritis-curve.png" alt="Graph showing the featuritis curve with User Happiness on y-axis and number of features on x-axis, showing a peak labeled Happy User Peak where adding more features begins to decrease user happiness" class="image-wide-30" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />
    
<p>For example, Starbucks now offers hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of drink combinations, which creates complexity that slows down service and makes operations harder. As Starbucks shifts toward a faster, drive-thru model, this overload of options is becoming a liability rather than a strength.</p>

<p>This is particularly common in the tech industry, where products are designed by engineers. For example, Microsoft was criticized for adding so many features to its Office Word product that the ribbon of multiple toolbars cluttered the interface. This hindered a person's use of the core benefit of a word processor: the ability to create text documents.</p>

<h2>What Is a "Product"?</h2>

<p>A <strong>product</strong> is a good, service, or idea consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible benefits. Note that, in addition to physical goods, a product can also be a service (e.g., the services of a stockbroker or a tax preparation company) or an idea (e.g., the ideas "sold" to the American public by political campaigns). Products consist of <em>tangible</em> benefits, which can be observed and touched, and <em>intangible</em> benefits, which cannot be observed or touched. Examples of intangible product benefits include enhanced social status, improved self-concept, brand-name image, etc.</p>


<p>There are 3 levels of product benefits:
<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-02-product-benefit-levels.png" alt="Concentric circles diagram showing three levels of product benefits with Core in the center, Expected in the middle ring, and Augmented in the outer ring" class="image-right-20" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Core product benefits</strong> – This is the basic level of benefits that the product has to offer to fit into the product category. For example, having a safe place to sleep is a core benefit of a hotel.</li>

<li><strong>Expected product benefits</strong> – These are the benefits beyond the core benefits that consumers expect from the product. For example, a private bathroom and comfortable bed aren't absolutely necessary, but customers expect most hotels to have these benefits.</li>

<li><strong>Augmented product benefits</strong> – Augmented product benefits are those benefits above and beyond what the customer expects. These benefits are a brand's chance to delight the customer and distinguish its product from the competition. For example, free room upgrades or complimentary welcome gifts are augmented benefits of a hotel stay.</li>
</ol>

<p>Marketers should start from the inside and work outward. That is, they should focus on providing the core product benefits first, the expected product benefits second, and the augmented product benefits third. In the context of positioning, core and expected product benefits that are shared across all brands in the category are <strong>points of parity</strong>, and augmented product benefits refer to <strong>points of difference</strong>.</p>

<p>In the long term, customers can come to expect benefits that were once considered augmented. For example, having free Wi-Fi in the room was once an augmented benefit of a hotel, but today it is generally considered an expected benefit by most guests.</p>

<p>To discuss product strategy, it is important to know the following key terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>product item</strong> is a specific product, identified by an alphanumeric ordering code known as its <strong>stock-keeping unit</strong>, or <strong>SKU</strong> (pronounced skew). For example, the SKU of a particular type of nail is F310R90G8BCPJ1AT. Every manufactured product (of a particular color, size, etc.) has a unique SKU that specifically identifies it and other identical items. For example, a pack of 2 Bounty paper towel rolls will have a different SKU than a 4-pack of the same paper towels.</li>

<p>SKUs help retailers and manufacturers keep track of inventory, and they make it easier for goods to flow through the channel of distribution. Note that SKUs are different from the numbers you might see at the bottom of a barcode, which gives the <strong>universal product code (UPC)</strong>. The first several digits give the company prefix (identifying the brand), the next several digits give the item reference (identifying the specific product item), and the last (typically 12th) is a check digit.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: SKU vs. UPC</h4>
<p>Whereas a SKU may differ from one retailer to another, a UPC is universal.</p>
</div>

<p>While QR codes have technical advantages over traditional UPC barcodes—such as the ability to encode more information—transitioning away from UPCs would be difficult. Some retailers are advocating for the switch, but UPCs are universally used and deeply embedded in retail infrastructure. Because both companies and consumers are so accustomed to scanning UPCs, replacing them with QR codes would present significant logistical challenges despite their potential benefits.</p>

<li>A <strong>product line</strong> is a group of product items that are closely related (because they satisfy a class of needs, are used together, are sold to the same customer group, are distributed through the same type of outlets, or fall within a given price range). A product line exists <em>within</em> an organization. For example, Coca-Cola's product lines include sparkling soft drinks, water/hydration, ready-to-drink alcohol, and coffee/tea.</li>

<li>A <strong>product mix</strong> is the set of product lines sold by a company. For example, Coca-Cola's product mix includes all of its products across all categories. Some companies have only one product line in their product mix, whereas other companies have a great variety of product lines in their product mix.</li>
</ul>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Product Terminology</h4>
<p>A SKU refers to a specific product item, a <em>product line</em> is a group of related product items under one brand, and a <em>product mix</em> is the assortment of all product lines and items a company sells.</p>
</div>

<p>The number of product items in a product line indicates the <strong>depth</strong> of the product line, and the number of product lines indicates the <strong>breadth</strong> of product lines in the firm's product mix.</p>

<h1>Product Life Cycles</h1>

<p>The <strong>product life cycle (PLC)</strong> describes the 4 stages a new product goes through in the marketplace: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. The concept of the product life cycle suggests what is likely to occur in the near future, which marketers can use as a basis for making better managerial decisions. A stylized life cycle for a typical product is below:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-03-product-life-cycle-chart.png" alt="Product life cycle chart showing sales and profit curves over time through four stages: Introduction, Growth, Maturity, and Decline, with corresponding marketing goals below each stage" class="image-wide-85" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>(In a given industry, profit and revenue follow a similar path, but profit is lower than revenue because profit is equal to revenues minus costs.) Note that the above diagram is highly stylized, whereas in reality, no product life cycle is quite as smooth and predictable. The product life cycle is an aid to marketing planning because the marketing mix differs at various PLC stages. The stages are described as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction stage</strong> – In the introduction stage, the product is first being introduced into the market. This stage is characterized by slow growth and low profit levels as the market comes to accept the product. There are few suppliers of the product at this stage. The focus should be on promotion to generate consumer awareness and consumer demand. The textbook discusses 2 kinds of consumer demand:
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary demand</strong> is the consumer's desire for the product class.</li>
<li><strong>Selective demand</strong> is the customer's desire for the specific brand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pricing during the introduction stage can either be high or low.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>skimming strategy</strong> is a strategy in which the firm sets a high initial price to help recover development costs. This capitalizes on the fact that customers are more price-insensitive up front. However, it may cause a lot of competition to enter the market.</li>
<li>A <strong>penetration pricing strategy</strong> is a strategy in which the firm sets a low initial price to build unit volume and gain market share. The firm must keep an eye on costs, however, as selling too many units too cheaply can be costly.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Growth stage</strong> – During the growth stage, sales increase rapidly, and profit usually peaks. <strong>Competitive entry</strong> occurs in this stage, as firms recognize the huge opportunity that the market offers. Pricing becomes more aggressive as more competitors enter the market, and the firm uses advertising to fight for selective demand and market share.

<p>In order to battle competing brands, a firm must start to market product variations and work to differentiate its brand from competitors, in order to gain and retain as much market share as possible. During this stage, the company usually implements changes, improvements, and new features to the product to help with differentiation. Distribution is key during this stage, and companies must fight for shelf space and possibilities for expanded distribution. Additionally, the number of repeat purchasers (people who tried it, liked it, and want to buy it again) increases during this stage, in proportion to first-time users.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Maturity stage</strong> – During the maturity stage, the growth of industry sales slows as the number of new buyers falls and most of the product purchasers become repeat purchasers. Marginal competitors begin to leave the market during this stage because of profit losses due to fierce price competition and an inability to attract new customers.

<p>At this stage, companies should try to maintain brand loyalty. Marketing efforts are aimed toward keeping existing customers and maintaining market share. Companies generally try to keep their products at the maturity stage as long as possible.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Decline stage</strong> – During the decline stage, profits begin to drop as new technology and new products make a product obsolete. This stage is characterized by a sharp decrease in sales. At this stage, firms must decide if it is worth it to continue making the product despite the decline in sales.

<p>At this point, the company can follow one of two strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Harvesting</strong> refers to retaining the product but reducing marketing costs so that customer requests can be met at a minimal cost to the company.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong> refers to removing the product from the company's product line. This is a drastic measure that can upset current customers who are still using the product.</li>
</ul>

<p>A firm may divest a product once it reaches the point where it is not profitable. When a marketing manager faces a product that is entering the later stages of its life cycle, he or she must decide whether to simply let the product fizzle out or to try to revive it. Normally, the goal of a brand manager is to keep the brand product life cycle going for as long as possible. However, outside forces may affect the brand manager's success.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: PLC Stages</h4>
<p>Be able to identify which stage of the PLC a company is in  (introduction, growth, maturity, or decline) and the appropriate primary marketing goal for that stage (expand awareness,  emphasize differentiation,  preserve loyalty, or harvest or delete).</p>
</div>


<p>Although the general nature of the typical product life cycle curve helps marketers in marketing planning, they should be aware that the product life cycle for any given product will be different.</p>

<h2>Some Dimensions of the Product Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Product life cycles differ by length and shape:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Length of the product life cycle</b> – Business products have longer product life cycles than consumer products. Mass communication has the effect of informing customers faster and speeding up product life cycles. Technology shortens life cycles as new technology replaces old technology more rapidly.</li>

<li><b>Shape of the product life cycle</b> – The generalized life cycle shows a gradual increase in sales, then a huge increase in sales, followed by a flattening out and a small decrease in sales. However, there are other life-cycle shapes for different products:
<ul>
<li><strong>High-learning products</strong> require significant education before use. Thus, the introductory period is extended. (e.g., 3D printers)</li>
<li><strong>Low-learning products</strong> do not require much learning, so sales begin to increase immediately. (e.g., crayons)</li>
<li><strong><em>Fashion products</em></strong> are introduced, decline, and then seem to return. These cycles can exist over years or decades, as they follow trends that can repeatedly come in and out of style. (e.g., skinny jeans)</li>
<li><strong><em>Fads</em></strong> experience rapid initial sales, then decline just as rapidly, resulting in much shorter PLCs. (e.g., fidget spinners)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The concept of <strong>diffusion of innovation</strong> describes how a product spreads to new users. There are generally 5 categories of product adopters:
<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-05-diffusion-innovation.png" alt="Bell curve showing diffusion of innovation with five categories: Innovators 2.5%, Early Adopters 13.5%, Early Majority 34%, Late Majority 34%, and Laggards 16%" class="image-right-35" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>Innovators</em></strong> (the first 2.5% of adopters) – Venturesome, more-educated people who use multiple sources of information</li>

<li><strong><em>Early adopters</em></strong> (the next 13.5% of adopters) – Social leaders with slightly above-average education</li>

<li><strong><em>Early majority</em></strong> (the next 34% of adopters) – Deliberate people with many informal social contacts</li>

<li><strong><em>Late majority</em></strong> (the next 34% of adopters) – Skeptical people who are below the average social status</li>

<li><strong><em>Laggards</em></strong> (the last 16% of adopters) – People who fear debt and use neighbors and friends as primary sources of information</li>
</ol>

<p>Usage barriers, value barriers, risk barriers, and psychological barriers are all reasons why some people end up waiting to try a product. This means that companies must try to overcome these barriers (e.g., by offering warranties, usage instructions, free samples, etc.).</p>

<h2>Analysis of Product Life Cycle Levels</h2>

<p>The basic concept of the PLC can be applied to product classes, product forms, and brands.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Product class</strong> refers to the entire product category or industry (e.g., recorded music). A product class life cycle includes sales of all producers of the product class. For example, we could draw the product class life cycle of the car industry.</li>

<li><strong>Product form</strong> refers to variations within the product class (e.g., CDs, cassette tapes, MP3s). For example, we could draw the product form life cycle for hybrid cars or electric vehicles.</li>

<li>A <strong>brand PLC</strong> describes products of a specific brand within a product form. For example, we could draw the brand PLC for the Ford Mustang.</li>
</ul>

<p>Product class life cycles are longer than product form life cycles (which are longer than brand life cycles) because a product form will remain on the market for less time than its product class as a whole.</p>

<p>Brand and individual product life cycles are generally under marketing control, but <strong>product form life cycles are usually driven by technology and consumer tastes</strong>, which are outside the control of marketers and brand managers. For example, marketers could not extend the product form life cycle for cassettes, 8-track tapes, LP records, or CDs because technological advancements prompted customers to want their music in a different form.</p>

<p class="date">Monday, 9/29/25</p>

<h2>Extending the PLC</h2>

<p>In general, there are 4 ways in which marketers can extend the product life cycle:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market penetration</strong> involves selling more of the product within the same market. Essentially, a market penetration strategy attempts to extend the PLC by 'going deeper' into its <em>current market</em>—increasing sales without entering any new markets. One way to do so is to sell the product to a greater proportion of its target market (i.e., sell to a greater number of people in the current market by convincing users of competitors' products that they should switch to using your brand).</li>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Market Strategies</h4>
<p>The textbook combines market penetration and market development into one category (market modification). Dr. Cooke discussed them separately.</p>
</div>

<p>Another way to penetrate the current market is by going deeper into the pockets of current customers (i.e., increasing use among existing customers). For instance, firms can use <strong>frequency/loyalty programs</strong> to increase existing customers' frequency of purchase. Frequent flyer programs are one example. Some companies have loyalty-based strategies without a traditional frequency/loyalty program. For example, Apple creates an interconnected ecosystem of products and services—once a customer buys one Apple product, they are more likely to continue buying others (like AirPods, Apple Watch, or iCloud storage) because everything works seamlessly together, encouraging long-term brand loyalty without relying on points or punch cards. Likewise, Walmart has done this is by adding grocery items, which get current Walmart shoppers to enter its stores more regularly.</p>

<p>This is sometimes described as attempting to achieve a greater <strong>share of wallet</strong>—the percentage of a customer's expenditures that the firm accounts for (e.g., a retailer convincing existing customers to spend more at their stores). For example, Disney opened hotels and high-end restaurants around its theme parks in an attempt to capture basically every purchase a family makes during their vacation.</p>

<p>One tool to help determine which customers to look at when penetrating the market is the brand development index (BDI), which will be discussed later in this segment.</p>

<li><strong>Market development</strong> involves extending a product's life cycle by looking for new markets (i.e., finding new customers). The best example of this is increasing geographic reach, such as by exporting products to different countries. In class, Dr. Cooke showed a commercial that Oreo ran in China. Multinational marketing can be extremely difficult, but the potential benefits are significant.</li>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Market Development</h4>
<p>Expanding into new markets or targeting new market segments is a <b>market development</b> strategy for extending the PLC.</p>
</div>

<li><strong>Product modification</strong> involves extending the product life cycle by altering a product's characteristics—such as its quality, performance, or appearance—to increase sales. For example, Oreo has introduced dozens of new flavors, including pumpkin spice Oreo cookies. <strong>Product bundling</strong>—the sale of two or more separate products in one package—is a common approach to product modification. Microsoft has used product bundling in which it combines multiple products (such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel) in a single Microsoft Office package.</li>

<li><strong>Product repositioning</strong> involves changing the position that a product occupies in the mind of the consumer (relative to competitive products) by changing one or more of the elements of the marketing mix (e.g., changing the packaging and advertising without actually modifying the product itself). For example, Dr. Scholl's once marketed insoles primarily for older adults with foot pain, but repositioned the product to appeal to younger, active consumers by emphasizing comfort and energy for people on their feet all day—without changing the actual insole, just the branding and messaging. Likewise, A.1. repositioned its sauce by changing its brand name from A.1. Steak Sauce to A.1. Original Sauce, a condiment that can go on "almost everything."

<p>There are generally 4 factors that can trigger a repositioning action:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Reaching a new market</b> – A company may want to reposition itself in order to reach a new market.</li>

<li><b>Catching a rising trend</b> – Repositioning may allow a company to make its product "fit" with a new consumer trend.</li>

<li><b>Reacting to a competitor's position</b> – A company may want to reposition its product to avoid tough competition.</li>

<li><b>Changing the value offered</b> – A company can change the value the product offers by trading up or trading down.

<ul>
<li><strong>Trading up</strong> involves adding value to the product (or product line) through additional features or higher-quality materials.</li>

<li><strong>Trading down</strong> refers to reducing the number of features, quality, or price. Trading down often occurs as a result of <strong>downsizing</strong>—reducing the content of packages without changing package size, and maintaining or increasing the package price. Many companies—including Procter & Gamble and Georgia-Pacific—have engaged in downsizing, which is controversial among consumer advocates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Managing the Product Life Cycle</h1>

<p>The <strong>product manager</strong> (otherwise known as the <strong>brand manager</strong>) is responsible for managing existing brands throughout the product life cycle, and many product managers are responsible for developing new products. Product managers also analyze data relating to market share, sales, and profit trends.</p>

<p>Two tools that can be used to manage the product life cycle are the brand development index (BDI) and category development index (CDI).</p>

<h2>Brand Development Index (BDI)</h2>

<p>The <strong>brand development index (BDI)</strong> is a tool used to determine how well a firm's brand is performing in each geographic territory in which it sells. The BDI describes the percentage of a brand's total sales that fall within a market segment in relation to the percentage of the total population that falls within that market segment. For example, the brand development index for Territory J looks at the ratio of sales per capita in Territory J to national sales per capita.</p>

<p>BDI is calculated as follows:</p>

\[
BDI_J = \frac{\$ \text{ Brand sales per capita in Territory J}}{\$ \text{ Brand sales per capita nationally}} \times 100
\]

<p>A BDI below 100 means that the brand's per-capita sales in that territory are below the brand's national average. A BDI of 100 means that the brand's per-capita sales in that territory are at the brand's national average. A BDI of more than 100 means that the brand's per-capita sales in that territory are above the brand's national average.</p>

<p>The BDI gives marketers a starting point to identify what a firm can do better with its brand. For any given brand, half of the markets are going to fall below the median, and half are going to fall above it. The BDI doesn't tell a firm anything about its absolute level of performance—it is just an indicator of how a brand is doing in one area relative to another.</p>

<h2>Category Development Index (CDI)</h2>

<p>The <strong>category development index (CDI)</strong> measures how an entire product category is performing in the market. The CDI describes the percentage of a product category's total sales that fall within a market segment in relation to the percentage of the total population that falls within that market segment.</p>

<p>CDI is calculated as follows:</p>

\[
CDI_J = \frac{\$ \text{ Category sales per capita in Territory J}}{\$ \text{ Category sales per capita nationally}} \times 100
\]

<p>Like with BDI, a CDI above 100 means that the category is doing better in that territory than the category's national average. A CDI of 100 means that the category is doing just as well in that territory as the category's national average. A CDI below 100 means that the category is doing worse in that territory than the category's national average.</p>

<p>Note that BDI and CDI are not restricted to comparing geographic territories; these calculations can also be applied to analyze ratios for specific segments of consumers in an overall population. For instance, Territory J could be grouped by income level or by age. Knowing BDI and CDI measures for different market segments helps brand managers decide how to compete and whom to target.</p>

<p>With knowledge of BDIs and CDIs, marketers can focus on the areas that are most promising for them. Market attractiveness can be analyzed using the following matrix:</p>

<p>Let's go through the calculations used to find the BDI and CDI for New York.</p>

<p><strong>Brand Development Index:</strong></p>

<p>We need the sales per capita in NY, so we divide the brand's sales in NY by the number of consumers in NY.</p>

<p>\[\$ \text{ Sales per capita in NY} = \$8\text{M} \div 10\text{M} = \$0.80\]</p>

<p>We also need the $ sales per capita nationally. We divide the brand's total sales of $60,000,000 by the number of consumers in the national market, given as 100,000,000.</p>

<p>\[\$ \text{ Sales per capita nationally} = \$60\text{M} \div 100\text{M} = \$0.60\]</p>

<p>Now we can find the brand development index:</p>

\[
BDI_{NY} = \frac{\$ \text{Brand sales per capita in New York}}{\$ \text{Brand sales per capita nationally}} \times 100 = \frac{\$0.80}{\$0.60} \times 100 = 133
\]

<p><em>A BDI greater than 100 indicates that the brand's sales in New York, on a per-capita basis, are higher than the national average.</em></p>

<p><strong>Category Development Index:</strong></p>

<p>To find the category sales per capita, we divide the brand's sales in a territory by the number of consumers there.</p>

<p>\[\$ \text{ Category sales per capita in NY} = \$27\text{M} \div 10\text{M} = \$2.70\]</p>

<p>\[\$ \text{ Category sales per capita nationally} = \$350\text{M} \div 100\text{M} = \$3.50\]</p>

\[
CDI_{NY} = \frac{\$ \text{Category sales per capita in New York}}{\$ \text{Category sales per capita nationally}} \times 100 = \frac{\$2.70}{\$3.50} \times 100 = 77
\]

<p><em>A CDI less than 100 indicates that the category's sales in New York, on a per-capita basis, are worse than the national average.</em></p>

<h1>Branding</h1>

<p><strong>Branding</strong> refers to the use of a name, phrase, design, symbol, or combination of these to identify products and distinguish them from competitors. The following are some basic terms used when discussing branding:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>brand name</strong> is a verbal label that is attached to a brand. Examples include Coca-Cola, Apple, Nike, and Pepsi.</li>

<li>A <strong>trade name</strong> is a commercial, legal name under which a company does business (e.g., the Coca-Cola Company).</li>

<li>A <strong>brand mark</strong> is a nonverbal representation of a brand. One example is the Nike swoosh.</li>

<li>A <strong>trade character</strong> is a personified or character-based representation of the brand. Examples include Ronald McDonald and Progressive's Flo.</li>

<li>A <strong>logo</strong> is an imprecise term referring to any verbal or nonverbal representation of a brand. Logos tend to be visual in nature and can consist of the brand name, brand mark, or both. Dr. Cooke showed how Pepsi uses slightly different logos for different products, like Pepsi Zero and Pepsi Max.</li>

<li>A <strong>trademark</strong> is a brand or trade name, brand mark, trade character, or logo that is legally protected so the firm has its exclusive use (thereby preventing others from using it). Trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and they are protected by the Lanham Act. <strong>Product counterfeiting</strong> refers to making copies of popular brands at low cost. Counterfeiting is a problem because it steals sales from the real trademark owner. Counterfeiting is a federal offense under the <em>Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act</em> (2006).

<p>Dr. Cooke mentioned that companies may become so popular that consumers start using the brand name as a common noun to describe all products in a category. Examples include Velcro (hook-and-loop fasteners), Band-Aid (bandages), and Post-it (sticky notes). Companies work to protect their brand names from becoming generic words because they fear losing their trademark. (It's particularly bad when your brand becomes a verb, like "Google" or "Xerox.")</p>

<p><strong>Trade dress</strong> refers to the visual appearance and overall image of a product or its packaging that signifies its source to consumers. This can include elements like color schemes, shapes, layout, and design features that make a product instantly recognizable—similar to a trademark, but focused on look and feel rather than logos or words.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="aside-box">
<h4>Picking a Good Brand Name</h4>

<p>Picking a good brand name is not an easy task. Many companies spend significant amounts of money doing just that. A good brand name generally meets the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name should suggest the benefits the product offers.</li>
<li>The name should be distinctive, memorable, and positive.</li>
<li>The name should fit the product or company image.</li>
<li>The name should have no regulatory or legal restrictions.</li>
<li>The name should be emotional and simple.</li>
<li>The name should have favorable semantic and phonetic associations in other languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before selecting a brand name, you should check the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's website (www.uspto.gov) to be sure that it has not already been registered.</p>
</div>

<h2>Family Branding vs. Multiple Branding</h2>

<p><strong>Family branding</strong> (also known as <strong>multiproduct branding</strong> or <strong>corporate branding</strong>) is a situation in which a firm puts the same basic brand name on all of the products it sells. For example, Nike puts its brand name on all of its products, from shoes to swimsuits.</p>

<p>Family branding allows a firm <strong>to take advantage of a strong brand name</strong>. A strong brand name makes it more likely that people will try, and ultimately adopt, the product.</p>

<p>Family branding allows positive experiences with one branded product to be transferred to other products, enabling <strong>line extensions</strong> (using a current brand name to enter a new market segment in the same product class), <strong>sub-branding</strong> (combining a corporate or family brand with a new brand), <strong>brand extensions</strong> (using a current brand name to enter a different product class), and <strong>co-branding</strong> (pairing two or more strong brands to provide mutual benefit).</p>


<p><strong>Co-branding</strong> occurs when two companies or brands cooperate and put both brand names on a product. This is typically done with short-term alliances (e.g., for specific products or advertising campaigns) in an attempt to achieve synergy. For example, Taco Bell and Doritos teamed up to offer the Doritos Locos Tacos, which had tremendous success. 
<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-07-doritos-locos-tacos.png" alt="Image of Doritos Locos Tacos showing co-branding between Taco Bell and Doritos" class="image-right-15" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>

<p>Excessive brand extensions, sub-branding, and co-branding can lead to <strong>brand dilution</strong>, which occurs when consumers stop associating a brand with a specific product and start thinking less favorably about the brand as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple branding</strong> (also known as <strong>multibranding</strong>) is a situation in which a company attaches distinctive brand names to the various products it sells. This approach is most useful when a company is using each brand for a different market segment (i.e., a multi-segment strategy). Large corporations commonly use multiple branding in their marketing strategy to have products positioned at various places on the map. For example, Procter & Gamble's marketing program uses multiple branding; the firm has many different brand names (such as Ace, Always, Bounty, and Crest) that represent different products that it manufactures.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Branding Strategies</h4>
<p>Make sure you know the difference between family branding and multiple branding.</p>
</div>

<p>The introduction of <strong>fighting brands</strong> is a special kind of multibranding in which a company introduces a brand as a defensive move against competitors. For example, Frito-Lay introduced Santitas tortilla chips to take sales away from a tortilla chip brand that was reducing sales of its Doritos brand. Promotional costs are higher for multibranding than for the multiproduct approach, but because each product is branded differently there is no risk that the failure of one product will negatively affect another product.</p>

<h2>National Brands vs. Private-Label Brands</h2>

<p><strong>National brands</strong> are the kinds of brands that we typically talk about in the context of consumer goods, such as Ragu, Goya, Betty Crocker, Tide, etc. These brands are designed to attract consumers to the brand and develop <em>brand</em> loyalty. National brands are responsible for most of the major innovations and advertising in a market, and they take part in a lot of research and development. Moreover, national brands typically have higher prices and more marketing behind them.</p>

<p><strong>Private-label brands</strong> are those brands associated with a particular retailer. For example, Kirkland is Costco's private label brand. The focus of private labels is to build <em>store</em> loyalty. Trader Joe's is well known for its numerous private-label brands, which account for the majority of its sales. Private-label brands are close to national brands in terms of quality, but innovation and advertising tend to be much lower for private-label brands. Note that private-label products are different from <strong>generic</strong> products, which have no brand name at all.</p>

<p>With <strong>private branding</strong> (also known as <strong>private labeling</strong> or <strong>reseller branding</strong>), a company manufactures products and sells them under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding tends to generate high profits for manufacturers and resellers. Private brands account for 1 in 5 items purchased at U.S. supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers.</p>

<p>With <strong>mixed branding</strong>, a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. For example, Elizabeth Arden has skincare products under both its Elizabeth Arden brand name and the "Skin Simple" private label, which is sold at Walmart. The two products are priced differently to appeal to consumer segments that have different price sensitivities.</p>

<p>Why would a manufacturer of a national brand compete against itself by producing for a private-label brand as well? It can actually be beneficial for the customer, retailer, and manufacturer:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>customer</b> benefits because he or she gets a product that is often as good as or better than the national brand for a lower cost.</li>

<li>The <b>retailer</b> benefits because it can achieve better margins with a private-label brand. The customer purchase price is lower, but the retailer's costs are significantly lower as well. (Retailers often purchase these products from the same manufacturers, but they don't have to advertise them like national brands do.) Thus, retailers make a higher profit by selling units of their own brand than they do by selling units of a national brand.</li>

<li>The <b>manufacturer</b> benefits because it can make use of its excess materials and inventory, and it doesn't have to bear the risk of customers not purchasing those additional units. Further, the manufacturer often can achieve better margins by selling the product to a retailer (for the retailer's private-label brand) than it could by trying to sell more of its own national brand. Although production cost will be the same whether the manufacturer is producing for a private-label brand or for its national brand, the manufacturer's total costs are lower for private-label brands, because it doesn't have to pay the costs of research and development, nor the costs of marketing and advertising those units.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p><strong>Licensing</strong> a contractual agreement whereby one company (the licensor) allows its brand name(s) or trademark(s) to be used with products or services offered by another company (the licensee) for a royalty or fee. In other words, a firm that owns a brand name sells another company the rights to manufacture and sell products under that brand name. For example, Disney licenses its characters to producers of various kinds of merchandise. Under this arrangement, Disney receives a fee and the producer who purchased licensing rights is able to make consumer products that are marketed using Disney's characters.</p>

<p>Licensing can be a major profit generator. Another benefit of using this strategy is that the company doesn't have to know anything about the product category that it is licensing its brand name to. For example, Disney could license the <em>Frozen</em> brand to a company that wants to sell Elsa dolls, without needing any knowledge of how to manufacture, package, distribute, or market dolls. Another example is UF's revenue from licensing the Gatorade brand name to Pepsi. (Interestingly, Gatorade isn't the top source of licensing revenue for UF. We generate more money from an anti-glaucoma medicine and a termite treatment.)</p>

<h2>Brand Equity</h2>

<p><strong>Brand personality</strong> is a set of human characteristics associated with a brand name (traditional, rebellious, rugged, sophisticated, etc.). Marketers can give a brand personality through advertising, and consumers often buy products that match up with their own desired self-image.</p>

<p><strong>Brand equity</strong> is the added value that a particular brand name provides to a product (beyond the functional benefits provided). For example, you might be willing to pay just $22 for an unbranded bottle of wine and $119 for the same bottle of wine with a Robert Mondavi label on it. The difference between the two prices is the brand equity that the Robert Mondavi brand brings to that bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Brand equity (1) provides a competitive advantage and (2) allows the company to charge more for a product. For example, people are willing to pay more for Duracell batteries than for "ordinary" batteries. Brand equity is created and maintained by communicating and acting on <strong>brand purpose</strong>—the reason a brand exists, its place in consumers' lives, the solution it provides to consumers, and the brand's role in benefiting society.</p>

<p>Many companies attempt to measure brand equity based on the brand's power to change consumer behavior. For example, Interbrand measures brand value based on financial forecast, role of brand, and brand strength. Apple is widely reported to have the highest amount of brand equity of any company in the world.</p>

<p>Important components of brand equity are awareness, brand image/associations, perceived quality, and loyalty.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong> refers to the degree to which potential customers are familiar with the brand. Firms want to be instantly recognized in the consideration set of their consumers, as awareness is the starting point of brand equity.</li>

<li><strong>Associations (brand image)</strong> refers to what comes to mind when the brand is mentioned. It is what the brand means to people, and it is at the core of brand equity. For instance, when you hear Häagen-Dazs, you might think of indulgence, premium quality, or a sophisticated dessert experience—even though the ingredients may not differ much from other ice creams. Similarly, when you hear Apple, you may associate it with innovation, sleek design, simplicity, and creativity.</li>

<li><strong>Perceived quality</strong> describes the extent to which consumers believe the product does a great job in delivering the desired product benefits. For example, consider how the perceived quality of Walmart compares with the perceived quality of Target.</li>

<li><strong>Loyalty</strong> is an important component of brand equity because it is essentially the result of the money invested in adding value to a brand name. Consumers who are very loyal to a brand devote repeated purchases to it. Moreover, they may be emotionally attached or psychologically committed to the brand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brand equity is intentionally and strategically built into the minds of consumers through the 4 general steps shown in the <strong>customer-based brand equity pyramid</strong>.</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-08-brand-equity-pyramid.png" alt="Customer-based brand equity pyramid showing four steps from bottom to top: Brand awareness, Brand performance and imagery, Consumer judgments and feelings, and Consumer-brand connection at the top" class="image-wide-70" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>The customer-based brand equity pyramid emphasizes that brand awareness is the foundation upon which brand performance and brand imagery (the 2 dimensions of a brand's meaning) are built. These, in turn, lay the foundation for consumer judgments and feelings, which ultimately lay the foundation for a connection between the consumer and the brand.</p>

<p>Brand equity is a financial benefit to the company that possesses it. The company can "cash in" on that financial advantage through licensing. However, care must be taken to ensure that the brand name matches up with the licensee's product.</p>

<p>Firms can <strong>extend brand equity</strong> by launching new products. In general, two ways in which this can be achieved are <em>line extension</em> and <em>category extension</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Line extension</strong> – A firm can build brand equity by introducing additional products in the same general product line using the brand name from the parent brand. Line extensions are very common. An example is Starbucks' launch of Pistachio Cream Cold Brew, an extension of its line of coffee products. Line extensions can increase brand awareness and decrease promotional and advertising costs, but they must be made such that they do not take sales away from the company's existing products.</li>

<li><strong>Category extension</strong> – Brand equity can also be built by extending a brand into other product categories. An example is Dyson (the vacuum cleaner company) launching a hair curler. One concern is that a company may dilute the original brand if it overextends, or ventures into a category that is too far from its existing brand associations. Additionally, a company could actually hurt the existing brand equity by associating the brand with a product that fails.</li>
</ul>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Line vs. Category Extensions</h4>
<p>A <b>line extension</b> occurs when a brand introduces a new product in an existing product line, whereas a <b>category extension</b> occurs when a brand enters a new product category.</p>
</div>


<h1>Packaging</h1>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong> refers to any container in which the product is offered for sale and on which label information is conveyed. A <strong>label</strong> is an integral part of the package and typically identifies the product or brand, who made it, where and when it was made, how it is to be used, and package contents and ingredients. Packaging and labeling account for 15% of the cost of the average product.</p>

<p>The packaging of a product can be used for repositioning, sometimes without making any changes to the product itself. The functions of packaging include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Contain or protect</b> – An obvious function is to contain or protect the product itself. For example, egg cartons are relatively shock-resistant because eggs are fragile.</li>

<li><b>Facilitate use</b> – Packaging can be used to make products easier to use. Examples include resealable packages of food and snack packs with separate compartments. For example, a package might separate hummus from crackers to ensure that the crackers don't get soggy.</li>

<li><b>Communicate</b> – Packaging can tell consumers about the specifics of the product and how to use it. In general, packaging is used to communicate information and to portray an image. For example, RXBAR protein bars have plain packaging with the ingredients clearly listed on the front to communicate its commitment to transparency, natural ingredients, and not using fillers. 
<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-08-chapter11-09-rxbar-packaging.png" alt="RXBAR protein bar package showing simple design with ingredients listed on front: 3 Egg Whites, 6 Almonds, 4 Cashews, 2 Dates, No B.S." class="image-right-10" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />Likewise, the Festina dive watch is sold in a bag of water to communicate that the watch is waterproof.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Fit channel needs</b> – Packaging can be used to make carrying the product easier for other members in the channel. Packing often functions to fit channel needs by making storage and/or transportation more convenient for distributors. For example, Chiquita redesigned its banana packing to be more efficient and easier for retailers to stack.</li>

<li><b>Innovation</b> – Packaging can be used to help a firm show that it is innovative, in an attempt to gain a leg up in the marketplace. This can differentiate the firm's products from its competition's products. For example, Pizza Hut used innovative packaging to appeal to consumers when it created a pizza box with built-in turntables.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Packaging and Labeling Challenges</h2>

<p>The following are some of the most important global trends involved in packaging:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><em>The need to connect with customers</em></b> – Marketers must design packaging to deliver customer value and capture the customer's attention. Aesthetics and functionality are more important than ever.</li>

<li><b><em>Environmental sensitivity</em></b> – Increasingly, consumers are concerned about the amount, composition, and disposal of packaging. This has led to increased use of recycled materials. Companies such as PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have decreased the amount of plastic they use in their bottled beverages.</li>

<li><b><em>Health, safety, and security concerns</em></b> – Consumers are demanding that companies ensure that their packaging and containers are safe. Thus, lighters almost universally come with child-resistant safety latches. Products that are sold in less-developed countries are benefiting from technology that extends their <strong>shelf life</strong> (the length of time the product can be stored).</li>

<li><b><em>Cost reduction</em></b> – As the costs of glass, paper, and plastics rise, firms are looking for ways to reduce the amount of materials used in their packages and containers.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Emerging Issues in Branding</h1>

<p>The following are two emerging issues in branding:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer-brand relationships</strong> – Increasingly, the relationship between consumers and the brands they like is becoming personal. For example, a brand that is poorly distributed and thus not on the shelves when you want to buy it is like a friend who says he or she is going to meet up with you but doesn't show up. Brand managers strive to maintain positive relationships between their brands and the consumers who buy and use them. Managing these brand relationships is important because brand advocates are loyal and recommend the brand to others.</li>

<li><strong>Brand communities</strong> – Brand communities involve multiple consumers that have relationships with each other because of a relationship with the brand. Companies encourage brand communities because they foster consumer-brand relationships. Interacting with other users in brand communities often reinforces consumers' notion of the brand as part of their identity.

<p>For example, the Harley Owners Group (HOG) consists of members who each have a relationship with the Harley-Davidson brand, which leads them to establish relationships with one another.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Product Warranty</h1>

<p>The <strong>warranty</strong> is a statement indicating the liability of the manufacturer for product deficiencies. There are various types of warranties that can be offered:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Express warranties</strong> are written statements of liabilities. There are 2 kinds of express warranties:
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited-coverage warranties</strong> state the bounds of coverage and the areas of noncoverage.</li>
<li><strong>Full warranties</strong> have no limits of noncoverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Implied warranties</strong> assign responsibility for product deficiencies to the manufacturer, even without a written statement of liabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Warranties may form a basis upon which a customer makes his or her purchase decision, and they can serve as a marketing advantage for the producer. Studies show that customer perceptions favor brands with full warranties over brands with limited warranties. Moreover, the popularity of holding manufacturers to "strict liability" in court over product defects makes warranties much more important.</p>

<h1>Variations of Products</h1>

<p>A company's ultimate success often depends on its ability to develop and market new products. Recall that a <strong>product</strong> is a good, service, or idea consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes that satisfies consumers and is received in exchange for money or some other unit of value.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Goods</strong> are products with tangible attributes that the five senses may perceive, though a good may also have intangible attributes when it comes to delivery or warranty.
<ul>
<li><strong>Nondurable goods</strong> are items that consumers use once or a few times (e.g., food products and fuel).</li>
<li><strong>Durable goods</strong> are items that sustain many uses (e.g., appliances, automobiles, and stereo equipment).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> are intangible benefits or activities that are offered for sale (e.g., marketing research, health care, and education). Services make up nearly half of the United States' gross domestic product.</li>
<li><strong>Ideas</strong> are thoughts that lead to actions. Examples include getting people out to vote or a concept that turns into a new product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies classify products to further marketing strategies, and governments classify products to keep up with industry data. One way to classify products is based on user type.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer products</strong> are products purchased by the ultimate consumer.</li>
<li><strong>Business products</strong> (also called <strong>industrial products</strong> or <strong>B2B products</strong>) are products that assist directly or indirectly in providing products for resale.</li>
</ul>

<p>Classifying goods based on the type of user is sometimes difficult. For example, Apple computers can either be sold directly to the customer (in which case they would be classified as consumer products), or they can be sold to a reseller, who then sells them to the ultimate consumer (in which case they would be classified as business products).</p>

<h2>Classification of Consumer Products</h2>

<p>There are four kinds of consumer products, which differ in terms of effort spent on the decision, attributes considered in the purchase, and frequency of the purchase:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience products</strong> are items consumers purchase frequently, conveniently, and with minimal effort.</li>
<li><strong>Shopping products</strong> are items for which consumers compare several alternatives on criteria such as price, quality, or style.</li>
<li><strong>Specialty products</strong> are items consumers make a special effort to seek out and buy.</li>
<li><strong>Unsought products</strong> are items consumers either do not know about or know about but do not initially want.</li>
</ul>

<p>The classification of consumer products into these four categories depends on the individual. One person can think that a product is a shopping good, whereas another person might think it is a specialty good.</p>

<h2>Classification of Business Products</h2>

<p>The sale of business products is the result of <strong>derived demand</strong>. That is, sales of business products depend on consumers' demand for consumer products. We can classify business products as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Components</strong> are items used in the manufacturing process that become part of the final product (e.g., raw materials, component parts, etc.). These items are often sold to industrial users.</li>
<li><strong>Support products</strong> are items used to assist in producing other goods and services. There are four main types of support goods:
<ul>
<li><strong>Installations</strong> (buildings and fixed equipment)</li>
<li><strong>Accessory equipment</strong> (tools and office equipment)</li>
<li><strong>Supplies</strong> (products such as stationery, paper clips, and brooms)</li>
<li><strong>Industrial services</strong> (intangibles that help the industrial buyer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Innovation and New Products</h1>

<p>The universal acceptance of the product life cycle (PLC) concept across industries emphasizes the importance of developing new products. Because all products will ultimately go into decline, organizations need to try to develop new products continuously to extend their brand life cycle(s). Accordingly, it is important for marketers to understand innovation and the new product development process. Additionally, successful new products can be highly profitable.</p>

<h2>What Is a New Product?</h2>

<p>"New" can mean many different things. Below are several ways to look at newness:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Newness compared with existing products</strong> – A functionally different product can be new. These "new products" can either create an entirely new industry (like the Apple II computer) or add features to an existing product (like digital devices that integrate cell phones, PDAs, digital cameras, and music players into one device).

<p>Consumers want products with many features but sometimes do not know how to use them. New product developers have to find ways to prevent <strong>feature bloat</strong> from turning into <strong>feature fatigue</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Newness in legal terms</strong> – The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says that a product is new until six months after it enters regular distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Newness from the company's perspective</strong> – There are 3 levels of "newness" from a company's perspective:
<ul>
<li><strong>Product line extension</strong>, an incremental improvement in an existing product (e.g., Purina's "Elegant Medleys")</li>
<li><strong>Significant technological jump</strong> (e.g., from a landline to a cell phone)</li>
<li><strong>True innovation</strong>, a new product that is truly revolutionary (e.g., the first computer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Newness from the consumer's perspective</strong> – This can be classified into three categories, based on the amount of learning that is involved:
<ul>
<li><strong>Continuous innovation</strong> does not significantly change how consumers live their everyday lives. The continuity of life is preserved when these products are introduced; consumers' adoption of the product doesn't require learning any new behaviors. These innovations include the introduction of new colors, new flavors, new styles, or new brands in existing product categories. For example, if Mattel develops a new Barbie doll with a slightly different look, this would qualify as a continuous innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamically continuous innovation</strong> requires a small amount of new learning and adjustment on the part of the consumer; consumers' adoption of the product involves only a few minor changes in behavior. These innovations include presenting an existing product in a different form (e.g., the Swiffer WetJet).

<p>Hello Barbie, a doll with artificial intelligence, is a dynamically continuous innovation. Incorporating AI technology provides a new way for kids to interact with Barbie that is different from how they would play with previous dolls: The child can now talk to the doll, and she will respond. Hello Barbie even remembers personal details about the user that she can bring up later.</p>

<p>Another example is the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine (which led to a similar but less-successful machine released by Pepsi) that lets customers choose a flavor to add to their soda. Dr. Cooke mentioned that Pepsi's version of the Coke Freestyle machine, the Pepsi Touch Tower, is an example of a "me-too" innovation.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Discontinuous innovation</strong> involves learning entirely new patterns of consumption. These innovations have broad social impact and change the way we live our lives. Discontinuous innovations are rare and generally involve the introduction of a radically new product category, which can initially be difficult for consumers to evaluate. Examples include telephones and the internet.

<p>More current discontinuous innovations might include autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars)—which could impact a variety of industries—and 3-D printing, which could revolutionize production.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Do New Products Succeed or Fail?</h2>

<p>New product development is expensive, and the vast majority of new products do not succeed. In fact, 95% of the 30,000 new products introduced annually are complete failures. New product failures are costly and frequent. Research shows that it takes thousands of raw ideas before a commercially successful product results. Eight marketing-related reasons for new product failures are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Insignificant point of difference</strong> – If a new product is not sufficiently different from existing competitive products, it will not succeed. This is shown to be the most important reason for new product failure.</li>
<li><strong>Incomplete market and product definition before product development starts</strong> – Research and development needs to be focused on a product and a market. This can be done through a <strong>protocol</strong>—a statement that, before product development begins, identifies: (1) a well-defined target market; (2) specific customers' needs, wants, and preferences; and (3) what the product will be and what it will do.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to satisfy customer needs</strong> – Even if the product's general quality is high, failure to satisfy customer needs on even a single dimension can be devastating. For example, a U.S. automaker that ships cars to Great Britain will not be successful if it fails to build cars that are driven from the right side!</li>
<li><strong>Bad timing</strong> – If consumer tastes change, the product may fail.</li>
<li><strong>No economical access to buyers</strong> – Shelf space is precious, and many times it is just unavailable for a new product.</li>
<li><strong>Poor execution of the marketing mix</strong> – Name, package, price, promotion, and distribution all have to be right for the product to be successful.</li>
<li><strong>Too little market attractiveness</strong> – The target market may be too small to be competitive or too small to justify spending money on reaching it.</li>
<li><strong>Poor product quality or sensitivity to customer needs on critical factors</strong> – Even if the quality is high, problems on just a couple of factors can kill the product. Sometimes less is more—making a product simpler may help it succeed, even if it means taking out useful but complicated features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from marketing-related reasons for new product failures, the following organizational problems can contribute to failures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Groupthink</strong> – Groupthink is the tendency of a group member to suppress objections and agree with others to gain acceptance from the group. Groupthink can restrain individuals from contributing important opinions during the new product process.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to address the NIH problem</strong> – In large, bureaucratic organizations, ideas are frequently rejected simply because they came from outside the organization. This is termed the "not-invented-here (NIH) problem." Companies can deal with this problem by encouraging <strong>open innovation</strong>, the use of internal and external ideas and collaboration when conceiving, producing, and marketing new products and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Measuring how new products impact company sales allows marketers to determine the effectiveness of the new product development effort.</p>

<div class="other-box">
<h4>New Product Vitality Index</h4>

<p>The New Product Vitality Index tracks the "vitality" of a company's new product development effort as follows:</p>

<p>\[\text{New Product Vitality Index} = \frac{\text{Sales from new products released in the past 3 years}}{\text{Total current year sales}} \times 100\]</p>

<p>A company's New Product Vitality Index is considered "good" if it is between 20% and 30%.</p>
</div>

<h1>The Process of New Product Development</h1>

<p>The <strong>new-product development process</strong> (or the <strong>new-product planning process</strong>) describes the stages a firm goes through to identify business opportunities and convert them to a salable good or service.</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-09-chapter10-01-funnel-new-product-planning-process.png" alt="Funnel diagram showing new product planning process stages from 60 ideas at idea generation narrowing down through feasibility screening to 12 ideas, concept testing to 9 ideas, business analysis to 7 ideas, prototype development to 3 ideas, market testing to 2 ideas, and commercialization to 1 idea" class="image-wide-50" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>The new product planning process can be thought of as a funnel because we start with a lot of ideas but end up with just a single viable one. Ideas that are able to advance further have higher rates of success staying on the market. Firms seek to improve the chances of their new products' success in being adopted by consumers. Firms increase their chances of success by introducing products only after they have made it all the way through the process.</p>

<p>Procter & Gamble has managed to have more new-product successes than most firms. P&G maximizes its chances of success by relying on a systematic new-product planning process. The process that P&G has developed is supposedly able to increase a new product's chance of success to 50%. This is clearly much higher than the average success rate. The steps involved in the new product planning process will each be discussed in detail.</p>

<h2>New Product Strategy</h2>

<p>Before generating ideas, a company should consider basic ideas (e.g., the company's core competencies) and goals for new product strategy. For example, Apple is primarily about being refined and sexy, yet still user-friendly, so new products should follow this strategy. The firm scans the environment and identifies its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and then comes up with new product ideas or new markets that can be the targets of new product development.</p>

<p>Developing a <strong>new product strategy</strong> involves defining the role of a new product in terms of the firm's overall corporate or brand objectives. The firm must use environmental scanning to identify trends that pose either an opportunity for, or a threat to, the new product. The company must also identify the target market and the roles that the new product will be designed to serve.</p>

<p>Several new product strategies are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attract a new market segment</b> – Coca-Cola has been actively innovating to attract new market segments, particularly younger consumers like Gen Z. For example, in 2023 they launched Starry, a lemon-lime soda designed to replace Sierra Mist and appeal to a generation that had not been enthusiastic about soft drinks. They've also introduced unique offerings through their "Creations" line, such as Starlight and Y3000—flavors positioned as novel and futuristic to spark curiosity and interest. These efforts reflect Coca-Cola's strategy of using innovative flavors, AI co-creation, and eye-catching packaging to reach consumers who are looking for something fresh and different from traditional soft drink options.</li>
<li><b>Extend into a new product category</b> – Dyson began as a vacuum cleaner company but extended into new categories like hair care products and lighting. This type of category extension allows companies to leverage their expertise and brand reputation to enter entirely different markets and attract new customers.</li>
<li><b>Add services</b> – Companies might pursue new product strategies that involve adding services to complement existing products, enhancing customer value and building loyalty. For instance, a brand could offer installation, maintenance, or subscription-based support alongside physical products.</li>
<li><b>Launch new technology</b> – Smartphone manufacturers like Xiaomi have introduced cutting-edge innovations, such as trifold phones that expand into large screens. These technology launches represent dynamically continuous innovations that provide significant new functionality beyond previous offerings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Idea Generation</h2>

<p><strong>Idea generation</strong> involves developing a pool of concepts as candidates for new products. These ideas can come from a number of sources, including engineers, marketers, consumer ethnography, the internet, brainstorming sessions, focus groups, observation, suggestions, and competing products.</p>

<p>Open innovation, also known as <strong>crowdsourcing</strong>, is an approach that welcomes, or even encourages, new ideas from any source. Crowdsourcing can be done internally, by sourcing ideas from company employees, or externally, by sourcing ideas from the public. For instance, LEGO regularly uses crowdsourcing to come up with new LEGO set designs and other products. People submit designs online, customers vote to support their favorites, and a few winning designs are chosen to be produced and sold on shelves.</p>

<p>Traditionally, companies relied on employees in their research and development teams (or contracted research firms like IDEO) for new ideas. However, the bottom line is that ideas can come from anywhere. Marketers should collect ideas from a number of different sources, understanding that the vast majority of the ideas that they collect will be unworkable. In fact, it is estimated that for every 60 ideas generated during this stage, only 1 new product will ultimately be successful.</p>

<h2>Screening and Evaluation</h2>

<p><strong>Screening and evaluation</strong> involve internal and external evaluations of new product ideas to eliminate those that warrant no further effort. The two substages of the screening and evaluation step are feasibility screening and concept testing.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Feasibility screening (internal approach)</strong> – The feasibility screen involves a critical examination of each idea by considering whether the idea goes beyond the scope of the firm's capabilities. The business asks whether the product is technically feasible and whether it meets the objectives that were set during new-product strategy development.

<p>For example, McDonald's McWrap takes 60 seconds, on average, to assemble, compared with only 10 seconds for a burger. Upon introducing the McWrap, McDonald's average drive-thru wait time increased to its longest in at least 15 years. The preparation time of new menu items is an important consideration for the chain, as fast service is core to McDonald's sales. These are the kinds of issues that firms hope to recognize at the screening stage of the new product planning process.</p>

<p>Firms that specialize in services must be especially concerned with the interactions that their employees have with customers. This is a central idea to <strong>customer experience management (CEM)</strong>, which is the process of managing the entire customer experience within the company.</p>

<p>Approximately 80% of the ideas generated during the idea generation process are ultimately deemed infeasible. Therefore, this is the step at which the vast majority of new ideas are rejected. Feasibility screening reduces our 60 initial ideas to 12.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Concept testing (external approach)</strong> – Concept testing involves specifically testing the product concept with consumers. No actual product or prototype is produced at this stage; marketers simply describe the concept of the product to consumers, often through focus groups or mall-intercept surveys.

<p>For example, as part of a campaign about positive body image, Dove released body wash in multiple bottle shapes in an attempt to reflect how beauty does not have one perfect shape. However, women felt insulted by the insinuation that their bodies had weird bottle shapes. Such a consumer reaction would ideally be uncovered during concept testing.</p>

<p>Concept testing doesn't work as well for some new products, particularly discontinuous innovations, which can have ideas that are hard to convey. It is usually better when a new product is only slightly different from an existing one, rather than when a new product is totally unfamiliar to customers.</p>

<p>On average, of the 12 ideas that survive the feasibility screen, only 9 survive the concept test, rejecting another 25%.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Screening and Evaluation Approaches</h4>
<p><b>Feasibility screening</b> internally evaluates whether ideas align with a firm's capabilities and goals, whereas <b>concept testing</b> gathers external consumer feedback on product concepts.</p>
</div>
</ul>


<h2>Business Analysis</h2>

<p><strong>Business analysis</strong> involves specifying product features and the marketing strategy, and making the financial projections needed to commercialize a product. At this stage, the business does an economic analysis, legal examination, and market strategy review. During the market strategy review, the product is examined to see whether it can be distributed through existing channels and whether it will affect the sales of existing products.</p>

<p>Firms estimate the likely profits involved in selling the product based on projected sales and expenses. Business analysis typically involves <strong>demand forecasting</strong>. Business analysis is the first indication of how much production capacity the firm may need to satisfy consumer demand if the idea goes to market.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Demand Forecasting</h4>
<p><b>Demand Forecasting</b> is often part of the <b>business analysis</b> stage of the new product development process.</p>
</div>

<p>For every 60 new product ideas, only 7 look reasonable from a costs-versus-benefits perspective and therefore survive this step. Thus, the business analysis stage of the new product process eliminates about 22% of products that remained after the previous step.</p>

<h2>Prototype Development</h2>

<p><strong>Prototype development</strong> is the stage of the new product process in which the firm develops a few sample products or working models to do some testing. This involves turning an idea into a <strong>prototype</strong>—a full-scale operating model—and performing laboratory and consumer tests to make sure that it meets applicable standards. Moreover, the firm must be able to manufacture the new product with the required quality at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooke mentioned that Fisher-Price has an on-site "Play Lab" for prototype development. The goal of research at the Play Lab is to make sure that its toys are fun for children to play with and to catch bad aspects of toys that were previously unrecognized by designers.</p>

<p>About 43% of product ideas that make it through business analysis make it through prototype development, which narrows down 7 prototypes to 3 for the next stage: market testing.</p>

<h2>Market Testing</h2>

<p><strong>Market testing</strong> involves exposing actual products to prospective customers under realistic purchase conditions to see if they will buy them. This is typically accomplished through a reduced release of the product (such as by offering the new product only at particular stores or only in select regions).</p>

<p><strong>Test marketing</strong> refers to offering a product for sale in a defined area on a limited basis to find out if customers will actually buy the product. Marketers look for cities that are fairly representative of the U.S. population when they engage in test marketing. Marketers can use these test markets to get a realistic idea of potential sales volume and market share and to try out different marketing approaches. However, they are expensive and time-consuming, and they give competitors a chance to get to the national market first or to try to sabotage the test market.</p>

<p>There are several forms of test marketing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Standard test markets</strong> – Standard test marketing involves developing a product and then attempting to sell it through standard distribution channels in certain test markets. Ideally, the test markets will be representative of the product's real market.</li>
<li><strong>Controlled test markets</strong> – Controlled test marketing involves contracting the testing to an outside company. The company then pays retailers for shelf space and can guarantee a certain amount of distribution volume. IRI is the leader in controlled test marketing.</li>
<li><strong>Simulated test markets (STMs)</strong> – Simulated test markets are used because they are less expensive than full-blown test marketing. This involves setting up a full-scale test market in a limited fashion (e.g., in shopping malls).</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the 3 products that go into the market testing stage, only 2 make it out to the next stage of commercialization.</p>

<h2>Commercialization</h2>

<p><strong>Commercialization</strong> is the positioning and launching of a new product in full-scale production and sales. Companies usually engage in commercialization slowly and gradually because it is the most expensive step. One way to slowly commercialize is through <strong>regional rollouts</strong>, which refer to sequential expansion into different geographical areas to allow marketing activities to gradually build up.</p>

<p>If the firm has gone through the new-product planning process carefully, it has approximately a 50/50 chance of success in commercialization. That is, 1 of the remaining 2 product ideas should succeed and become adopted by consumers for long-term use.</p>

<h1>Product Adoption and Diffusion</h1>

<p>After a new product is introduced, the adoption process describes what happens on an individual level, and the diffusion process describes what happens on a market level.</p>

<h2>Adoption Process (Individual Level)</h2>

<p>The <strong>adoption process</strong> is the process by which the consumer decides to adopt a new product for continued use. The adoption process generally proceeds through the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Awareness</strong> – Before they can adopt a product, consumers have to be aware that it exists. This is where brand equity becomes particularly powerful, as awareness of a brand name is the most important step in the adoption process. Generating awareness can be especially important for dynamically continuous innovations, which must make consumers aware that the new product category exists.</li>
<li><strong>Interest</strong> – Once consumers are aware of a product, something about it must attract them or make them want to learn more.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation</strong> – Based on comparisons to existing products and alternatives, consumers must view the product favorably in deciding whether it is right for them.</li>
<li><strong>Trial purchase</strong> – After determining that they think highly of the new product idea, consumers might make a trial purchase of the new product. This initial purchase indicates that the consumer has deemed the product promising enough to try, which can be encouraged by free samples, coupons, in-store demonstrations, or other marketing promotions. Yet, this purchase does not end the adoption process.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption</strong> – Finally, consumers decide to adopt the product for continued use in the last step of the adoption process. Marketers can analyze how frequently and in what quantities the product-adopting consumers make repeat purchases. The goal is for each consumer in the process to fully adopt the new product into his or her normal purchase cycle, in order to begin to create a relationship with the customer.</li>
</ol>

<p>For some (typically low-involvement, inexpensive) products, the trial purchase step may be before the evaluation step. For example, an impulse purchase of a new type of mustard is a trial purchase made before the customer evaluates the product.</p>

<h2>New Product Diffusion (Market Level)</h2>


<p><strong>Diffusion</strong> refers to the cumulative proportion of the market that adopts the product. Over time, the percentage of the market that adopts a product grows. Marketers are interested in both how high the "% adoption" gets and how fast it gets there.</p>

<p>Initial growth is generally slow, and then the product really takes off. Eventually, growth slows down. The diffusion of all products eventually "flattens out" at an asymptote—this is the highest, or "peak," level of diffusion the product will ever achieve. These patterns involve two characteristics that can describe a new product's diffusion curve: the <strong>peak level of diffusion</strong> and the <strong>rate of diffusion</strong>.</p>
<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-09-chapter10-02-diffusion-curve-graph.png" alt="S-curve graph showing cumulative portion of market that adopts over time with percentage adoption on y-axis and time on x-axis showing slow initial growth then rapid growth then leveling off at asymptote" class="image-wide-35" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>Diverse diffusion rates indicate that certain products diffuse more quickly than others. For example, the radio and color TV diffused quite rapidly, whereas the stove and the washing machine were adopted at a slower rate.</p>

<p>On average, product diffusion rates have increased over time; this means that consumers in the market have been adopting products faster in more recent years. Dr. Cooke attributes the rise in diffusion rates largely to increased communication.</p>

<p>Research has revealed 5 main factors that influence a new product's rate of diffusion:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Relative advantage</strong> – Relative advantage refers to how great the advantage of the new product is over existing products. The greater the relative advantage, the more rapidly the product will diffuse. This is usually the most important factor influencing the rate of product diffusion.

<p>For example, color television diffused faster than black-and-white TV because the advantage of color was immediately clear to consumers. Similarly, smartphones offered a major relative advantage over basic cell phones by combining communication, mapping, and entertainment features in one device, accelerating their adoption.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Communicability</strong> – Communicability, or observability, refers to how easy it is for marketers to describe the new product's benefits. The greater the product's communicability, the more quickly it will diffuse. For example, inline skates have high communicability because people can easily see that they work like ice skates but without ice. In contrast, many new digital apps may have lower communicability because it's harder to immediately understand their function just by looking at them.</li>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong> – The product's complexity affects the speed at which it diffuses in that the more complex a product is, the more slowly it will diffuse. For example, the Jitterbug phone was designed to be very simple to use in order to target older consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong> – Diffusion is affected by how compatible the new product is with the culture into which it's being introduced. When people have to significantly change their habits to adopt a new product, diffusion will be slow.

<p>For example, dishwashers had a slow rate of diffusion into the Japanese market due to compatibility issues. Japan has notoriously sticky cuisine and smaller average kitchen sizes, and, at that time, Japanese housewives tended to feel that it was their duty to do the dishes by hand.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong> – Buying a product can involve various types of risk (e.g., financial, social, physical, and performance risks). A high level of risk results in a slower rate of diffusion of a product. The most obvious example is the financial risk associated with the trial purchase of expensive products.

<p>Savvy marketers recognize that perceived risks hinder the diffusion of their products, and they will take steps to minimize those risks. In some cases, manufacturers may introduce a product in small, trial-size packages, which reduce financial risk by providing a way for consumers to use the product as cheaply as possible. Marketers can also eliminate this risk involved in purchasing a product by offering the consumer an opportunity to try the product first (with free samples, test drives, in-store product demonstrations, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To increase a product's rate of diffusion, marketers want to maximize relative advantage, communicability, and compatibility, and they want to minimize complexity and risk.</p>

<h1>Organizing for Effective New Product Development</h1>

<p>Organizations increasingly use <strong>cross-functional teams</strong> to develop new products. Cross-functional teams, which have been widely adopted by large companies, involve people from a number of different organizational functions, including marketing, sales, research and development (R&D), production, and finance.</p>

<p>These individuals are brought together to focus on innovation and ensure that a new idea is both a good idea and a marketable one. Cross-functional teams involve multiple perspectives, making it more likely that issues and problems with the product will be realized and addressed.</p>

<p>Note that new product innovations can be developed outside of large corporations. For example, Kickstarter is a well-known platform for <strong>crowdfunding</strong>, which helps entrepreneurs finance creative ideas for new products. People from around the world donate online to the development of Kickstarter product designs. Crowdfunding can be an effective way for entrepreneurs and inventors to gather financial capital for their great ideas.</p>

<p>Additionally, some research programs (e.g., at universities) attempt to link scientists, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors, and industry to create a path from basic research to product commercialization.</p>

<h1>What Are Services? (The Four I's)</h1>

<p>A <strong>service</strong> is an intangible product that an organization provides to consumers in exchange for money or something else of value. Services are an increasingly important component of the global economy, particularly in the U.S., where services account for the majority of GDP. Four unique elements of services differentiate them from goods and present marketers with unique challenges. These elements, called the <strong>4 I's</strong>, are <em>intangibility, inconsistency, inseparability</em>, and <em>inventory</em>. Because of these characteristics, there tends to be much more dissatisfaction with services than with goods.</p>

<h2>Intangibility</h2>

<p>Services have an inherently <strong>intangible</strong> aspect that is not characteristic of goods. When a consumer buys a good, he or she gets a physical entity; with a service, the consumer gets something that is intangible. Because services cannot be held, touched, or seen, they are relatively hard for customers to evaluate.</p>

<p>The <strong>service continuum</strong> refers to the range from tangible to intangible, or from goods-dominant to service-dominant offerings.</p>
<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-10-chapter12-01-service-continuum.png" alt="Service continuum diagram showing spectrum from tangible to intangible with pure goods on left and pure services on right" class="image-wide-60 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>Most products have a combination of tangible and intangible benefits, so they fall somewhere between pure goods and pure services. Products that lie between the two ends of the service continuum have aspects of both, to varying degrees. For instance, when you order delivery from DoorDash, there is a more equal mix; you get both a tangible good (the food you eat) and an intangible service (the fast delivery).</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: The Service Continuum</h4>
<p>The service continuum ranges from tangible pure goods to intangible pure services.</p>
</div>

<p>It is more difficult for consumers to evaluate services than goods because of this intangible element of services. For this reason, some companies try to convey quality by making their services more tangible. For example, a hotel cleaning service might show a picture of a member of the housekeeping staff making a bed, which serves as a tangible reminder of the maintenance services they perform. Trade characters (such as Progressive's Flo) help personify intangible services (like insurance) by attaching a name and a face to them. All 9 major trade characters for insurance companies have favorability ratings of over 50%. The GEICO gecko has the highest favorability rating and 98% of consumers are aware of him.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Intangibility</h4>
<p>Intangibility makes services difficult to evaluate.</p>
</div>

<h2>Inconsistency</h2>

<p>Services depend on the people who provide them, so the quality of services is variable and <strong>inconsistent</strong>. This is in stark contrast to traditional goods, which can be consistently produced to meet certain quality standards. Because services involve such a large human component, they are much harder to control. For example, your hairdresser may give you a bad haircut one day and a great haircut another day.</p>

<p>One way to eliminate inconsistency is <strong>service industrialization</strong>—using automation, technology, and standardizing processes to eliminate as much of the human element as possible. Companies can minimize any potential remaining human error by training employees to be more uniform in providing the service.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Reducing Inconsistency with Services</h4>
<p>Service industrialization and standardization help reduce <b>inconsistency</b>.</p>
</div>

<p>For example, McDonald's goes to great lengths to standardize operations: The buns are dropped into a timed toaster, and the worker only has to put burger patties in a tray and press a button to cook them correctly. Even the sauce is put on with a squirt gun that is designed to deliver the correct dosage. These steps promote consistency in customers' experience at McDonald's.</p>

<h2>Inseparability</h2>

<p>The consumer cannot separate the service itself from the deliverer of the service. <strong>Inseparability</strong> means that, for the most part, the service provider and the consumer must be in the same place at the same time, and there will be some interaction between them. For example, a hairdresser and the person who is getting a haircut must be in the same physical location at the same time. This is different from the production and sale of goods because a firm can manufacture a good at a location and time completely separate from that of consumption. Therefore, goods can be inspected for defects before they reach the customer.</p>

<p>The amount of interaction depends on the extent to which the customer must be present to receive the service. Automated self-service technologies (such as ATMs and self-checkout) may be convenient, but they are perceived as less personal.</p>

<p>Rather than viewing inseparability as a threat, it can be seen as an opportunity for service providers to work with customers to co-create customer value. By allowing customers to be actively involved in the production of the service, <strong>co-creation</strong> (or <strong>co-production</strong>) enables customer feedback and customization, thereby increasing customer satisfaction. For example, you can ask the hairdresser to fix something you don't like to improve the quality of your haircut.</p>

<div class="other-box">
<h4>Co-Creating Customer Value</h4>

<p>The definition of customer value has evolved over time. Recall that customer value is defined as the collection of a product's perceived benefits divided by its cost. Perceived benefits used to encompass only the functional and emotional benefits of the brand and its products, but today, the calculation of customer value also includes <strong>participative benefits</strong>, which come from the interaction between the customer and the service provider. Therefore, customer value is now the sum of functional benefits, emotional benefits, and participative benefits divided by the price:</p>

<p>\[
\text{Customer Value} = \frac{\text{Functional benefits} + \text{Emotional benefits} + \text{Participative benefits}}{\text{Cost}}
\]</p>

<p>The addition of participative benefits into this definition recognizes that customers have higher perceptions of quality and higher satisfaction as a result of co-creation (i.e., when they actually participate in creating value).</p>
</div>

<h2>Inventory</h2>

<p>Because they are perishable in nature, services cannot be stockpiled; companies cannot really hold inventories of services the way manufacturers can hold inventories of goods. Because a service provider cannot accumulate services in inventory, there will sometimes be <strong>idle production capacity</strong>—when the service provider is available but there is no demand (e.g., hairdressers standing around not giving haircuts). <strong>Inventory carrying costs</strong> refer to the cost of paying the person to provide the service and the cost of the needed equipment.</p>

<p>Paying for service providers that do not work at full capacity (e.g., labor costs while employees are idle) amounts to wasted costs and lost potential revenues. For this reason, service managers must work hard to match service capacity with service demand. Some industries are driven entirely by this concept, using <strong>yield management</strong> techniques to match supply with demand.</p>

<p>For example, airplanes taking off with empty seats is important because the lost revenue from an empty seat on a plane can dramatically impact an airline's profitability. One of the ways airlines attempt to ensure full flights is by overbooking. If a flight is overbooked and not enough people cancel to fit all of the passengers on the plane, airlines transfer overcapacity to other flights.</p>

<p>In the hotel industry, yield management focuses on minimizing idle production capacity — in other words, ensuring rooms are occupied as much as possible to maximize revenue. Since hotel rooms are perishable (an empty room tonight can't be sold tomorrow), hotels use strategies like dynamic pricing, last-minute deals, and third-party platforms such as Priceline. These methods allow hotels to discreetly offer discounted rooms without directly lowering their brand's standard rates. For example, a luxury hotel might quietly fill vacant rooms at a discount through external booking sites while protecting its premium image. Yield management in hotels is all about adjusting pricing and availability in real time to match demand and ensure rooms are generating income rather than sitting empty.</p>

<p>Social media is another tool that can be used to manage this element and better use perishable service "inventory." Platforms like Groupon enable a provider with excess capacity to eliminate it at a low price without sacrificing its ability to charge a higher price to "normal" customers during peak hours.</p>

<h1>Classifying Services</h1>

<p>Services can be classified based on the following 3 dimensions:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Delivery by people or equipment</b> – Both skilled and unskilled individuals provide services (e.g. appliance repair, nighttime security). Services can be classified as equipment-based or people-based, depending on how they are delivered.

<ul>
<li><strong>People-based services</strong> can be provided by unskilled labor (e.g., security guards), skilled labor (e.g., plumbers), or professionals (e.g., lawyers). Sometimes, however, the people are removed from the service by equipment or machines (e.g., electric utilities).</li>
<li><strong>Equipment-based services</strong> can be automated (e.g., ATMs), operated by relatively unskilled operators (e.g., taxis), or operated by skilled operators (e.g., airlines). Services provided by equipment generally do not suffer from inconsistent quality because human error is removed.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Profit or nonprofit organizations</b> – Nonprofit organizations' gains are not taxed and thus return to the company to continue to provide the service. Nonprofit organizations employ about 10% of the workforce and are more frequently turning to marketing efforts, particularly social media, to help promote their causes.</li>

<li><b>Government-sponsored or not</b> – All levels of government provide services. For example, the U.S. Post Office is embracing the internet to make its services more accessible.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Customer Satisfaction</h1>

<p><strong>The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI)</strong> measures customer satisfaction in different industries and sectors. Separating the results of the ACSI's customer satisfaction index by sector and by industry confirms that satisfaction is typically lower the more <b>service-dominated</b> an industry is. Customer satisfaction tends to be higher the more an industry is based on providing tangible products, such as manufactured goods.</p>

<p>Customer satisfaction is an important factor affecting a company's annual returns, and it is directly correlated with company performance. The ACSI constructed a stock portfolio that only consisted of the stocks of companies with high consumer satisfaction rankings and compared its returns to that of the S&P 500. From 2006 to 2024, the ACSI leader stocks had returns that were nearly quadruple the returns of the S&P 500 stocks. Unsurprisingly, people are more likely to recommend companies that they are satisfied with.</p>

<h2>The Purchase Process</h2>

<p>Services are hard to evaluate at many levels. They are hard to evaluate before purchase because they are intangible, and they are hard to evaluate post-purchase because service quality varies with each purchase. Moreover, there are few (if any) <em>search</em> properties (e.g. color, size, style) with services. Nevertheless, there are a number of different qualities that consumers look for in services, which fall into 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experience properties</strong> (which are discerned either during or after consumption)</li>
<li><strong>Credence properties</strong> (trust in and reliability of the service provider)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many customers turn to other people as sources of information about service purchases because of the difficulty in evaluating services objectively.</p>

<h1>Service Quality</h1>

<p>Just as we identified different levels of product benefits, we can define a service in terms of the different levels of benefits it provides:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core service</strong> – For a retailer, the core service is having the right product, at the right place, at the right time, and at the right price. When people walk into the store, they should be able to find and buy what they want. This is the basic reason for the existence of a typical service-based company.</li>

<li><strong>Expected service</strong> – A service provider cannot just provide a core service; it must go beyond the core service and provide the expected service to customers. For example, a retail service provider must meet customer expectations regarding things like dependability and courtesy.</li>

<li><strong>Augmented service</strong> – A service provider is simply at parity with its competitors when it provides the core and expected service. To gain an edge over competitors, a service provider must distinguish itself by providing augmented service. James Cash Penney (founder of JCPenney) once said, "It is the service the customer doesn't expect that endears the customer to the store."

<p>Augmented service refers to going above and beyond to provide great service to the customer. This augmented level of service in the territory that customers don't expect is what leaves them delighted and is what builds a lifelong bond between customers and the company.</p>
</li>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Service Differentiation</h4>
<p>Remember that <b>augmented service</b> is what gives a service provider an "edge" over the competition.</p>
</div>

<li><strong>Potential service</strong> – Potential service refers to a pool of ideas for providing better service that have not yet been implemented. As we have discussed, augmented benefits quickly become expected. As a result, service providers must continually come up with new ways to improve their service offerings. Note that an idea is still a potential service while the service provider considers the future service attribute but has not yet applied it.

<p>An example of potential service in retail is the idea of offering customers a "just looking" button when they enter the store. This button would signal to sales associates that the shopper prefers to browse without assistance unless they choose to ask for help. This simple addition could improve the customer experience by respecting individual preferences and reducing unwanted sales pressure.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the following example for an airline:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Core service</b> – The airline safely and efficiently transports passengers from one location to another.</li>
<li><b>Expected service</b> – Passengers expect professional flight attendants, basic courtesy, reasonable comfort, and standard amenities like beverage service.</li>
<li><b>Augmented service</b> – Unexpected benefits, such as KLM's use of dogs to return lost items to passengers by matching their personal scent to the scent on the items.</li>
<li><b>Potential service</b> – Innovative ideas like family-style seating cabins that enhance interaction and comfort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like the levels of product benefits, these service levels must be met from the inside out; core and expected service levels must be met before augmented services can be considered. Additionally, in the long term, customers can come to expect services that were once considered augmented.</p>

<h2>Dimensions of Service Quality (RATER)</h2>

<p>Research has shown that consumers evaluate service quality on the 5 dimensions described by the RATER model. This model seems to be an accurate description of how consumers assess service quality in most industries.</p>

<p>The RATER dimensions are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong> – If a service has high reliability, consumers know what they're going to get; they can count on the service provider to deliver what has been promised, similar to the notion of consistency and dependability. The dimension of service quality that is identified as <b>most important</b> is reliability. A firm must keep its service promise to customers and provide what customers expect.</li>

<li><strong>Assurance</strong> – The service provider guarantees its customers that things are going to be taken care of and that they are in good hands. Front-line employees, who are usually the first to make an impression on customers, should convey an attitude of confidence to assure customers that their issues will be handled effectively. Brand mottos are also often used to increase assurance. For example, Allstate's slogan, "You're in good hands," is designed to increase the insurance company's assurance.</li>

<li><strong>Tangibles</strong> – Recall that services are largely intangible. However, most services have some tangible aspects. Examples of tangible manifestations include free samples and trade characters, as well as appearance-related indications of quality such as the cleanliness of the store and uniforms of its staff.</li>

<li><strong>Empathy</strong> – This is another attitudinal aspect of service quality through which the provider communicates to the customer that he or she cares. This is the "personal touch" dimension of service quality that involves providing individualized attention to customers. Good service companies go to great lengths to teach employees how to deal with upset customers. One approach to dealing with upset customers is to "give them an E.A.R.—empathy, attention, and respect." There is a debate about whether empathy can be trained.</li>

<li><strong>Responsiveness</strong> – Responsiveness involves being willing and able to meet demand (<b>availability</b>) and responding appropriately when there is a problem (<b>recovery</b>).

<p>Progressive Insurance improved responsiveness by empowering their agents to handle auto claims directly at the accident site. Instead of customers waiting days for an agent to inspect the vehicle at a service station, Progressive increased the number of agents and equipped them with mobile tools to assess damage, take necessary photos, and issue claim payments on the spot. This streamlined process reduced customer frustration and enhanced satisfaction by providing immediate support during a stressful situation.</p>

<p>Service <strong>recovery</strong> refers to a service provider's response when a customer complains about a poor customer experience (i.e., a service failure). Disney has a well-known, formal service recovery model that bases the company's response to a problem on both the severity of the problem and the company's degree of responsibility for it. A matrix of these responses is as follows:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-10-chapter12-03-disney-recovery-matrix.png" alt="Disney service recovery matrix showing four quadrants based on problem severity and company responsibility" class="image-wide-35 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Service Recovery Model</h4>
<p>Know which characteristics are associated with each response in Disney’s service recovery model.</p>
</div>

The procedures for each quadrant are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Empathy</strong> – When the problem is not very severe and Disney is not to blame, employees are empathetic to customers. For example, if rain interrupts a family's day at a theme park, employees are told to be particularly sympathetic and understanding with customers, but no further action is taken.</li>

<li><strong>Fix it</strong> – When the problem is not very severe but Disney is to blame, Disney simply fixes the problem. For example, when an employee serves a guest the wrong order at a restaurant, Disney simply fixes the problem by giving the guest the food that he or she ordered.</li>

<li><strong>Red carpet</strong> – When the problem is relatively severe and Disney is to blame, the company rolls out the red carpet for the guest. For example, Disney once double-booked a honeymoon suite, leaving one couple with nowhere to stay. Disney responded by providing the couple with a free, upgraded suite at another property and free dining options to make up for the service failure.</li>

<li><strong>Hero</strong> – When the problem is relatively severe but Disney is not to blame, Disney sees an opportunity to take on the role of a hero. For example, a family was once stranded by a Gray Line bus near a Disney hotel. Frustrated, they called Disney to see how they could get transportation. Even though it was not Disney's fault that the family got stranded, Disney responded by picking them up and providing them with complimentary entrance to the park and Fast Passes. The family was so delighted that they wrote an entire blog post about it online.</li>

<p>A well-known example of service recovery involves a child's lost stuffed animal, Snuggle Puppy, left behind at a hotel. Instead of simply returning the toy, the hotel staff staged a thoughtful experience. They took photos of the stuffed animal "working" various jobs at the hotel—like helping at the front desk, doing data entry, and visiting the gym—before shipping it back with a note describing its adventures. This creative and empathetic response not only delighted the child but also left a lasting positive impression on the family, turning a service failure into an opportunity for exceptional customer satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Extended Gap Model of Service Quality</h2>

<p>Companies must continuously find ways to provide quality customer service so that customer perceptions meet customer expectations. Gap analysis is a way of assessing service quality in which differences between the consumer's expectations and experiences are identified.</p>

<p>Expectations are gained through word of mouth, past experiences, promotional activities, and personal needs. Actual experiences are based on how the organization delivers its service.</p>

<p>Customers make implicit comparisons between their expectations—what they hope to receive—and their perceptions of what they actually receive. A <strong>quality gap</strong> is a source of poor-quality service that exists when customer perceptions fall short of customer expectations.</p>

<p>While the <strong>gap model</strong> of service quality sums up the negative difference between customer perceptions and expectations as one quality gap, the <b><em>extended</em> gap model</b> examines a number of potential stages of poor service that may be causing a given quality gap. The various <em>quality gap components</em> are as follows:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-10-chapter12-04-gap-model-diagram.png" alt="Extended gap model diagram showing flow from customer expectations through various gaps to customer perceptions" class="image-right-40 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge gap</strong> – A knowledge gap exists between what customers expect and what management thinks customers expect. This gap occurs when a firm does not know what its customers want, often because it has not done enough quality market research. For example, managers of a hotel may be under the impression that customers care most about the hotel's gym, when they actually care most about the cleanliness of the room.</li>

<li><strong>Standards gap</strong> – A standards gap exists when management accurately perceives customer expectations but sets up inappropriate specifications—standards for service—in attempting to satisfy those expectations. For example, hotel managers may not know how to ensure that the rooms are cleaned. They may even have a checklist for housekeeping, but if the items on the checklist are not the things that customers care about, there is a standards gap.</li>

<li><strong>Delivery gap</strong> – A delivery gap exists when management correctly identifies customer expectations and develops appropriate standards for fulfilling them, but the implementation of the service plan goes awry. In such cases, managers know what they want to do but just can't deliver it well. This gap can be due to incompetent or unmotivated employees, so it can be minimized with improved human resources to hire good service employees and improved employee training. For example, if managers ask the cleaning staff to do too much in too little time, they may be unable or unwilling to meet specifications and ensure that the room is clean.</li>

<li><strong>Communications gap</strong> – A communications gap exists between implementation (what companies really do) and their external communications to customers (what companies tell customers they are going to do). This can happen if a company is implementing its service well, but its customers don't understand what the company is providing. For example, if the hotel promotes itself as a five-star hotel online but doesn't live up to that standard, there is a communications gap between the level of cleanliness the hotel actually provides and the level of cleanliness that customers expect based on how the hotel described itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>If a company manages to get rid of these different types of gaps, its consumer perceptions should match its consumer expectations, and the company will be seen as having high-quality service. The vast majority of dissatisfied customers do not complain to the company when there is a service failure. Increasingly, they post a report of their dissatisfaction on the internet. Marketing departments are paying more attention to social media and managing their online reputation.</p>

<h1>Customer Retention</h1>

<p>Research indicates that customers become more profitable over time, suggesting that maximizing customer retention can be rather valuable. For this reason, it is beneficial for firms to look at customers from a <em>relational</em> perspective, aiming for a long-term, ongoing relationship. <strong>Customer retention</strong> is increasingly important in all industries, but especially in service industries. If a company can retain a customer, the total profit it enjoys just from that customer often greatly outweighs the costs of attracting and retaining the customer in the first place. Companies earn larger profits from repeat customers for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Larger, more frequent purchases</b> – Customers retained for an extended period of time tend to make larger, more frequent purchases.</li>

<li><b>Reduced operations costs</b> – As companies get to know the customer, operations costs fall. Serving existing customers is less expensive than setting up for new clients.</li>

<li><b>Referrals</b> – Satisfied customers tell other customers about their positive experiences, thereby providing free advertising and generating more revenue for the firm. This can lower the costs of attempts to acquire new customers.</li>

<li><b>Price premium</b> – In some cases, companies can charge a price premium when they have extremely loyal customers. Over time, people's price elasticity decreases as their commitment to the company increases. Loyal, returning customers will cut you some slack if you have to raise prices slightly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Customer lifetime value (CLV)</strong> considers the lifetime value of satisfying customers. Note that firms generally care more about profitability than revenues, as profit is a more relevant metric to measure a customer's value. If we know the firm's profit margin, we can calculate the customer lifetime value in terms of profits rather than in terms of revenues. An example of a firm's calculation of customer lifetime value is as follows:</p>

<div class="example-box">
<h4>Example: Customer Lifetime Value</h4>

<p>The following are data collected from purchase records and customer surveys for Starbucks:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Silver</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Gold</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Platinum</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Visits per month</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">3.9</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">4.3</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">7.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Profit per visit</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$3.88</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$4.06</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$4.42</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Average life as a customer</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1.1 years</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">4.4 years</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">8.3 years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Customer lifetime value</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$199.74</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$921.78</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$3,169.67</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>To calculate the lifetime value, you calculate the average number of total visits per year. You then multiply that amount by the average profit earned per visit. Finally, you multiply that amount by the average number of years the consumer is a customer. So, the calculation for the CLV of each "silver" customer (described above) would be as follows:</p>

<p>\[
\text{CLV} = (\text{Profit earned per visit}) \times (\text{Visits per year}) \times (\text{Average life as a customer in years})
\]</p>

<p>\[
\text{CLV} = (\$3.88) \times (3.9 \text{ visits per month} \times 12 \text{ months per year}) \times (1.1 \text{ years}) = \$199.74
\]</p>

<p>As you can see, the lifetime value to Starbucks of a platinum customer is $3,169.67, whereas the lifetime value to Starbucks of a silver customer is $199.74. This example drives home the importance of customer retention and customer satisfaction.</p>
</div>

<p>This simplified CLV calculation is an over-estimation of CLV for 2 reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It fails to account for continuous defection, or customers who stop spending money on the product throughout their lifetime.</li>
<li>it ignores the time value of money by not discounting future cash flows to reflect their present value, meaning future earnings are treated as if they are worth the same as today's dollars.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relationship Marketing</h2>

<p><strong>Relationship marketing</strong> is an effort by a company to develop a long-term, cost-effective link with individual customers for the mutual benefit of the customer and the organization. The relationship has to be two-sided: the organization must receive a stream of profits, and the customer must receive a stream of value from the company. Two relationship-marketing approaches are frequency marketing and database marketing:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency marketing</strong> is the general term applied to attempts to reward people for the frequency of their business (i.e., loyalty programs). Frequent flyer programs, credit card rewards programs, and loyalty punch cards are examples of this. The overall goal of frequency marketing is to create brand loyalty and thus achieve a greater <strong>share of wallet</strong>—the proportion of a customer's overall purchases spent on the company's products.

<p>This is related to the concept of "lock-in" for building customer loyalty. A company can create lock-in by developing ways to make the customer dependent on its products, or by forming barriers that increase the customer's cost of switching to a different brand. Customer loyalty programs can create lock-in because they entice customers to keep purchasing from the company—rather than from a competitor—in order to work towards a promised reward (like a free burger on the tenth visit).</p>

<p>Bundling products is another method companies can use to increase revenues and share of wallet, and it can also have the benefit of creating lock-in. For example, Cox Communications found that its average monthly churn is lower (i.e., its customer retention rate is higher) for customers who have bundled multiple services together (such as internet, TV, and phone). Because of this, the company goes to great lengths to get people to buy these bundled services.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Database marketing</strong> involves using large collections of data to make marketing decisions. Companies can use databases to gather information about customers' birthdays, important people in their lives, styles that they prefer, and more. Database marketing is often used in <strong>customer relationship management (CRM)</strong>, which uses software to manage customer relationships. Companies frequently use CRM to determine how much attention they should give to certain customers.

<p>Database marketing allows marketers to identify a customer's <strong>RFM</strong>: how <strong>r</strong>ecently they purchased, how <strong>f</strong>requently they purchase, and the <strong>m</strong>onetary value of their purchases.</p>

<p>Marketers can use RFM analysis in conjunction with the <strong>customer pyramid</strong> to put customers into different groups based on their profitability.</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-10-chapter12-05-customer-pyramid.png" alt="Customer pyramid showing platinum gold iron and lead customer segments from most to least profitable" class="image-right-35 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<ul>
<li><strong>Platinum customers</strong> are the most valuable. They are the most profitable, they are not price-sensitive, and they are highly loyal to the company.</li>

<li><strong>Gold customers</strong> are profitable but not quite as committed to the company as platinum customers. Organizations should go out of their way to treat gold customers well, but not as well as platinum customers.</li>

<li><strong>Iron customers</strong> provide the volume needed to utilize the firm's capacity, because most customers are at this level; however, their profitability isn't enough to warrant special treatment.</li>

<li><strong>Lead customers</strong> cost the firm money (such as by driving away good employees or by consuming more company resources) and are ultimately unprofitable. The firm wants to minimize this lead segment, ideally by turning them into iron customers. If this isn't possible, the firm should find an appropriate way to terminate the relationship with these customers (i.e., not serve them at all).</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, marketers adopting a CRM approach should be willing to spend the most time, effort, and money to serve customers higher up in the pyramid.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Marketing Experiences: The Experience Economy</h1>

<p>A market offering can come in the form of a commodity, good, service, or experience. Take, for example, the possibilities for market offerings of coffee:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Commodity</strong> – Supplying (undifferentiated) raw coffee beans that consumers must bring home and roast/grind/brew to have coffee</li>

<li><strong>Good</strong> – Selling varieties of roasted beans or ground coffee at the supermarket, which only requires consumers to brew the coffee at home</li>

<li><strong>Service</strong> – Serving coffee that has been freshly brewed by a restaurant or coffee shop</li>

<li><strong>Experience</strong> – Staging an experience for enjoying customized or specialty coffee, offered in a pleasant environment

<p>For example, Starbucks markets its coffee shops as a "third place" (a space, in addition to home and work, where people can gather and dwell). To provide a welcoming environment and create an enjoyable experience, Starbucks locations feature comfortable seating, soothing background music, and free Wi-Fi.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As a product progresses through these levels, the price consumers are willing to pay rises (often by more than the marginal costs for the company to improve the offering). For example, a cup of coffee made from beans ground at home costs about 10 cents, whereas a cup of Starbucks coffee (service and experience included) can cost more than $5! Further, as an offering develops towards becoming an experience, customer retention—and, therefore, profit margins—increase.</p>

<p>In order to promote ongoing, long-term relationships and customer loyalty, companies are increasingly trying to make their services an all-encompassing, enjoyable experience for their customers—particularly Millennial customers, who are leading the growth in consumer spending on experiences.</p>

<p>The notion of going beyond delivering services by staging experiences is referred to as the "experience economy." The experience economy is especially important for Millennials and Generation Z.</p>

<h2>Customer Contact and Relationship Marketing</h2>

<p>A firm can focus on the steps that make up a service by setting up a <strong>customer contact audit</strong>—a flowchart of the points of interaction between the consumer and the service provider. Points of customer contact are important because research shows that the sincerity and authenticity of customer interactions are major determinants of the success of a customer service relationship. The textbook applies a customer contact audit to a car rental service, identifying "touchpoints" at which the car rental service can gain a competitive advantage by improving interactions with the customer.</p>

<p>Repeated interactions give the service provider an opportunity to develop a relationship with the customer. This may be facilitated through rewards programs like frequent flier miles. An ongoing relationship can benefit both the consumer and the service provider.</p>

<h1>Managing the Marketing of Services</h1>

<p>Recall that the traditional marketing mix includes the 4 P's—product, price, place, and promotion. While service providers must effectively manage these "four P's," the special nature of services requires them to also consider 3 more P's—people, physical environment, and process. Collectively, these important considerations for service providers are called the <strong>7 P's of services marketing</strong>. Below, we will discuss the 7 P's of services marketing in detail.</p>

<h2>Product (Service)</h2>

<p>When developing services, managers must come up with offerings that include the benefits that customers want. They also have to pay particular attention to branding, which is crucial for services. The brand name or logo is more important in service organizations because there is no tangible good to trigger consumer decisions. Therefore, organizations have to undertake creative branding activities to develop a strong brand image in the mind of the consumer.</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>Price is expressed in many ways in the context of services (charges, fees, fares, rates). Prices serve 2 major roles:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>They are an indicator of the quality of the service.</em> Higher-priced services are perceived as being better than lower-priced services.</li>

<li><em>They play a role in capacity management.</em> <strong>Off-peak pricing</strong> consists of charging different prices for a service during different times of the day or days of the week to reflect variations in demand (e.g., airlines offering discounts for travel at nonpeak times).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that price is not the only consideration for customers who buy services. Consumers also consider nonmonetary costs, such as the effort required to consume the service.</p>

<h2>Place (Distribution)</h2>

<p>Because services are inseparable from the service provider, convenient distribution is key. National hair salons, tax preparers, accounting firms, and banks have multiple locations to better serve their customers. Service firms increasingly use the internet to deliver services 24/7.</p>

<h2>Promotion</h2>

<p>Promotion presents the benefits of purchasing the service, so it is important to stress key value creators, like availability, location, consistent quality, etc. The following forms of promotion play a role in services marketing:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Publicity</em> is important in the promotional strategy of nonprofits, which commonly use free public service announcements in their media plans.</li>

<li><em>Personal selling</em> by service firm representatives often results in a sale.</li>

<li><em>Sales promotion</em>, in the form of coupons, contests, and free trials, is often offered as incentives.</li>

<li><em>Direct marketing</em> is often used to communicate with specific audiences that may be interested in the firm's service offerings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>People</h2>

<p><em>People</em> are highly important in services because of the high degree of interaction between the customer and the service provider. Customers typically assess the quality of the service based upon their perceptions of the employee, so it is key to hire and train the best people.</p>

<p>Because the employee in a service organization is crucial in ensuring that the customer is satisfied, many firms use a concept called internal marketing. <strong>Internal marketing</strong> is based on the idea that a service organization must focus on its employees, or the <em>internal market</em>, before successful programs can be directed at customers. Employees need to have the proper attitude, skills, and commitment, so employee development is critical. Moreover, firms must understand that customer behavior can affect service quality for other customers.</p>

<p>Internal marketing is just one component of <strong>customer experience management (CEM)</strong>—the process of managing the entire customer experience. CEM experts say a customer experience should be planned, consistent, differentiated, and valuable to the customer. CEM can be used to develop simple customer relationships into customer loyalty.</p>

<h2>Physical Environment</h2>

<p>The physical environment in which the customer interacts with the service provider may affect the customer's perception of service quality. This includes such things as the facility, landscaping, signage, and equipment. Through <em>impression management</em> (also called <em>evidence management</em>), firms strategically manage the physical environment to create the right impression, or mood, in the mind of the consumer.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>Customers judge a service's quality based on the procedures, mechanisms, and activity flows by which the service is delivered. Managers can improve the process by which services are created and delivered through the use of a customer contact audit.</p>

<p>Because the service is inseparable from the service provider, service companies must try to match demand with capacity and ensure that the assets of the organization are used to achieve the maximum return on investment. <strong>Capacity management</strong> refers to the integration of the service component of the marketing mix with efforts to influence consumer demand. The goal of capacity management is to match capacity with demand over the course of a demand cycle while maximizing the firm's return on investment.</p>

<div class="example-box">
<h4>Capacity Management</h4>

<p>Marketing dashboards for airlines contain measurements of <em>yield</em>, <em>load factor</em>, and <em>operating expenses</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yield</strong> refers to the revenue gained per seat for flying one mile.</li>
<li><strong>Load factor</strong> refers to the percentage of available seats occupied by a paying customer, per mile.</li>
<li><strong>Operating expense</strong> refers to the cost per seat for flying one mile.</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers feed into an airline's operating income or loss. Specifically, the airline's operating income or loss can be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>\[
\text{Operating Income} = (\text{Yield} \times \text{Load Factor}) - \text{Operating Expense}
\]</p>

<p>So, let's say an airline earns 9.83 cents per seat, per mile, and it costs the airline 8.28 cents per seat, per mile to fly. Moreover, assume that 82.1% of the seats are filled for every mile flown. Its operating income per mile would be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>\[
\text{Operating Income} = (0.0983 \times 0.821) - 0.0828 = -0.002096
\]</p>

<p>So, for every mile flown, this airline is losing 0.2096 cents. This is obviously not what the airline wants to do.</p>

<p>Let's say you are the airline's marketing manager, and you want to increase operating income to the <em>breakeven point</em>—the point at which you are neither earning money nor losing money on each mile flown. Assuming the airline's operating expense and yield do not change, you would need to increase the load factor. The following algebra tells you by how much you would need to increase the load factor:</p>

<p>\[
\text{Operating Income} = (\text{Yield} \times \text{Load Factor}) - \text{Operating Expense}
\]</p>
<p>\[
0 = (0.0983 \times \text{Load}) - 0.0828
\]</p>
<p>\[
0.0828 = 0.0983 \times \text{Load}
\]</p>
<p>\[
\text{Load} = 0.0828 \div 0.0983 = 0.8423 \text{ (or 84.23%)}
\]</p>

<p>So, as a marketing manager, you would have to take steps to increase the airline's load factor from 82.1% to 84.23% just to break even.</p>
</div>

<h1>Services in the Future</h1>

<p>We can expect new, better services in the future, as well as an increasingly large variety of services. These changes will likely be the result of 3 factors:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Technological developments</em>, such as 5G and advances in artificial intelligence, enable companies to more efficiently provide services. In fact, generative AI is maturing rapidly and is already transforming customer service.</li>

<li><em>Improved understanding of delivery and consumption of services</em> is due to new data and information from market research. Service marketers are increasingly engaging in netnography—the use of online data about consumer opinions and experiences—to better understand the behavior of service consumers.</li>

<li><em>The social imperative for sustainability</em> means that green practices are greatly influencing consumer decisions and their assessment of services. Service providers will increasingly have to focus on their environmental implications.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Promotional Mix</h1>

<p><strong>Integrated marketing communication (IMC)</strong> is the design of marketing communication programs to coordinate all promotional activities and provide a consistent image of an organization to all of its audiences. IMC is also a key component of customer experience management.</p>

<p><strong>Promotion</strong> is just one of the aspects of the marketing mix. A firm's <strong>promotional mix</strong> is the combination of the promotional elements it chooses to use. These elements include advertising, personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, and direct marketing. Promotional activities are used to (1) inform prospective buyers about the benefits of the product, (2) persuade them to try the product, and (3) remind them later about the benefits they enjoyed by using the product.</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-11-chapter18-01-marketing-mix-diagram.png" alt="Marketing Mix diagram showing Product, Promotion, Place, and Price with Promotion broken down into Direct Marketing, Public Relations, Sales Promotion, Personal Selling, and Advertising" class="image-right-50 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>The traditional major elements of the promotional mix are described as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Advertising</strong> refers to any kind of paid media insertion, or nonpersonal communication about an organization, good, service, or idea by an identified sponsor. Advertising can be placed in a magazine, website, television program, or radio program, among others. Because the company pays for the exposure, it gets to choose how and when the message is sent. However, advertising is costly, and the advertiser receives no immediate feedback.</li>

<li><strong>Personal selling</strong> is a two-way communication between a customer and a representative of the organization. The key aspect of personal selling is the interaction between buyer and seller. It is designed to influence an individual or a group's purchase decision and usually involves face-to-face communication. The seller can choose exactly whom to direct the message to, and he or she can get immediate feedback. However, it is hard to ensure that different salespeople will present the same message, and personal selling is usually costly. In fact, personal selling commands the largest portion of a typical marketing budget.</li>

<li>A <strong>sales promotion</strong> is a short-term inducement offered to arouse consumer interest in a good or service to increase short-term sales. Some examples include coupons, free samples, and contests. While sales promotions often increase sales in the short term, the gains are temporary, and sales promotions will not suffice as the only element in a promotional campaign. Moreover, they will lose effectiveness if they continue to be used over the long run.</li>

<li><strong>Public relations</strong> is the firm's attempt to influence publicity and its company reputation. Press releases and company-sponsored events are examples of public relations tools that aim to influence the feelings, opinions, or beliefs of customers, prospective customers, stockholders, suppliers, employees, and other members of the public about a company and its products or services. Other examples include lobbying, press conferences, and image management.

<p><strong>Publicity</strong> is a nonpersonal presentation of a firm or product; it is essentially what a third party says about a brand, and marketers do not directly control its content. Examples of publicity include a news story, an editorial, or a new product announcement. Publicity lends credibility to the message, but it is difficult to control.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Public Relations vs. Publicity</h4>
<p>Be sure you understand the difference between public relations and publicity: A firm cannot directly control the publicity it receives from the media, but it can control its public relations response.</p>
</div>

<p>Interestingly, negative publicity is not always bad for sales. One study of <em>New York Times</em> book reviews showed that negative reviews for relatively unknown authors actually <em>increased</em> sales by 45%, presumably because the reviews made the public aware of the books. Note that bad publicity is only good for products that have pretty low awareness. (Negative reviews of established authors decreased book sales by 15%.)</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Direct marketing</strong> refers to communications with individual customers to generate an order, request further information, or encourage a visit to a retail outlet. Direct marketing is often associated with database marketing. Examples include catalogs and flyers sent through U.S. mail, telemarketing, marketing emails, and spam. Direct marketing is flexible because it involves interactive communication. However, maintaining a database of the target market can be costly. In addition, response rates are falling due to privacy concerns.</li>
</ul>

<p>The textbook divides the traditional promotional elements into 2 categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Mass selling elements</b></em>—advertising, public relations, and sales promotion—are geared toward groups of buyers.</li>
<li><em><b>Customized interaction elements</b></em>—personal selling and direct marketing—involve customized interaction between sellers and prospective buyers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Nontraditional IMC Tools</h2>

<p>According to one survey, U.S. millennials' top purchase influencers are (1) recommendations from family and friends, (2) emails that they opted-in to receive, (3) online consumer reviews, (4) TV ads, (5) social network ads, (6) video streaming ads, (7) smartphone ads, (8) influencer social media posts, and so on. This demonstrates that greater influence comes from mediated relationships with customers independent of the brand—<strong>earned media</strong>—as opposed to owned media.</p>

<p>Due to media fragmentation and a lack of consumer trust in marketer-controlled media, it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to effectively promote their brands and products with the traditional tools of the promotional mix. This has driven the increasing use of nontraditional tools, which have become an important aspect of many firms' marketing programs.</p>

<p>Some of the most important nontraditional integrated marketing communication tools include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sponsorship</strong> is a marketing tool by which a company pays to have its name or advertisement attached to some portion of an event. For example, corporations like Coca-Cola, XFINITY, and Monster Energy pay to sponsor each NASCAR Cup Series or Truck Series, which is named after that sponsoring brand. Within each series, companies sponsor individual races and drivers. Among U.S. sports leagues, the NFL receives the most sponsorship revenue, with over $2 billion in 2023.

<p>One way to determine whether an investment in sponsorship is worth the cost is to compare the exposure per dollar with the sponsorship to the exposure per dollar with traditional paid advertising tools. The following are 4 goals that companies should strive for when sponsoring an event:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Importance to target customers</b> – The event has to be something that the target customers really care about.</li>
<li><b>Large enough investment</b> – The investment has to be large enough so that target customers believe that the event depends heavily upon the sponsor (that it may not have occurred at all without the sponsor).</li>
<li><b>Activation (engagement)</b> – Activation involves bringing the marketing message to life in the mind of the consumer. Major brands are increasingly using similar efforts at music festivals to <em>engage</em> consumers in <em>experiential</em> activations. For example, at Coachella 2024–2025, brands such as NYX, JBL, and American Express ran on-site, creator-driven experiential activations with shoppable content and augmented reality (AR) try-ons.</li>
<li><b>Linkage (fit)</b> – There should be some link or alignment between the event and the brand. For example, some NASCAR sponsors (including Pennzoil and FedEx) have a clear connection to the event. Other sponsors (including AARP and Pedigree pet food) have almost no logical connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>One problem with sponsorships is that other companies may try to seize some of the goodwill associated with being a sponsor without paying to be an actual sponsor—a technique called <strong>ambush marketing</strong>. For example, Dr. Cooke described how Nike, Pepsi, Burger King, and a number of other companies were not official sponsors of the 2012 Olympic Games, yet many people thought they were because those companies advertised heavily during the Olympics.</p>

<p>Because of the problems associated with being a sponsor of an event that a company does not directly control, many marketers turn to <strong>event marketing</strong>—instead of sponsoring an existing event, a company creates its own event, which it selfsponsors. A well-known example is Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, which is held every Fourth of July.</p>
</li>

<li>A <strong>product placement</strong> occurs when a firm inserts a brand-name product into a movie, video game, or television show to gain seemingly natural exposure. (However, some brand insertions do not feel as natural in the middle of the regular content of a movie or television show, resulting in awkward product placements that are obvious to consumers.) This is a great way to get around the problem of people fast-forwarding through commercial breaks when watching recorded television shows, such as with a DVR.

<p>Product placements have existed for a long time. The filmmakers of E.T. pioneered modern product placement by first asking Mars, Inc. for money to feature M&M's. When Mars declined, they offered a similar deal to Hershey. Hershey agreed, and Reese's Pieces sales jumped 70% after E.T. was released. The film transformed an obscure brand into a major candy market player and established product placement as a powerful marketing tool.</p>

<p>Product placement can take place under different purchasing arrangements:</p>

<ul>
<li>In a <b>straight fee</b> arrangement, the owner of the brand that will appear in the programming pays a fee to the producer of the movie or television program.</li>
<li>Another form of product placement is <b>barter</b>, a situation in which a company provides a product for use in a television show or movie in exchange for the exposure generated from its use. This arrangement is typically used for cars, tech products, and other expensive items.</li>
<li><b>Cross promotion</b> involves an arrangement in which a movie or television show features a product and the maker of the product, in turn, advertises for the movie or television show. For example, Reese's Pieces and E.T. created multiple co-branded ads and products promoting the movie.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Infomercials</strong> are generally longer-form commercials, often involving celebrity endorsements, discussions, and product demonstrations. Infomercials are a form of direct-response TV advertising because they prompt viewers to call immediately to order the product, allowing marketers to gauge the infomercial's effectiveness at triggering sales.</li>

<li><strong>Branded entertainment</strong> creates entertainment to gain viewers' attention and focus them on a specific brand or product. Marketers strive to find ways for their brands to entertain potential customers. You can think of branded entertainment as a form of event marketing in which the event is content (e.g., a show with a storyline) produced by the company. For example, "Life's Rewards" is a dramedy series (streaming on Amazon Prime Video) that Visit St. Pete/Clearwater created to promote tourism in Tampa Bay.

<p>One concept related to branded entertainment is <strong>guerilla marketing</strong>, where companies attempt to do something outlandish and unique (often with creative outdoor advertising) in order to garner attention. For example, the following ad shown was part of a guerilla marketing campaign by Pepto-Bismol (in a laundromat).</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-11-chapter18-02-pepto-bismol-guerilla-marketing.png" alt="Pepto-Bismol guerilla marketing campaign showing washing machines in a laundromat modified to look like pink stomachs" class="image-wide-30 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>Another related concept is <strong>crowdsourcing advertising</strong>. For example, for several years, Doritos sponsored an annual contest for the Super Bowl, in which contestants submitted commercial ideas. This is a way for the company to engage its customers and access a pool of ideas for relatively little money and little risk. (Moreover, some of the commercials that resulted went viral.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mix Element Characteristics</h2>

<p>The following are key characteristics of the elements of the promotional mix:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>They perform different tasks.</em> Marketers should use the IMC tools and techniques that are most appropriate at different parts of the campaign, such as using different methods for increasing awareness and for conveying the message.</li>
<li><em>The promotional campaign is consistent.</em> The elements of the promotional mix must portray a consistent brand image across the different channels or media forms.</li>
<li><em>The mix elements allow marketers to capitalize on complementarity.</em> The different elements of the promotional mix should work together, reference each other, and fit seamlessly in order to achieve the desired overall effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>When developing an IMC program, the marketer must have the right balance of promotional mix elements. This is affected by the target audience, the stage of the product's life cycle, the product's characteristics, the consumer's stage in the buying decision, and channel strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The target audience</b> – The target audience can either be the ultimate consumer or an intermediary. If promotional programs are directed at the ultimate consumer, marketers typically use some kind of mass media. Many firms also use <em>behavioral targeting</em> by collecting information about consumer behavior patterns and individually targeting them. Personal selling and targeted advertising in trade journals, on the other hand, are generally used for selling to business buyers. Personal selling is also an important component of publicity aimed at intermediaries.</li>

<li><b>The product life cycle</b> – Different promotional mixes are appropriate for different stages of the product life cycle:
<ul>
<li><em>Introduction stage</em> – All elements are used, but advertising is important because it generates awareness and interest. Publicity may begin as well.</li>
<li><em>Growth stage</em> – Advertising is the primary promotional mix element because it distinguishes the product from different brands. Personal selling is also used to solidify distribution channels.</li>
<li><em>Maturity stage</em> – Sales promotions (e.g., coupons) are used to maintain loyal buyers. Direct marketing (e.g., direct mail) may also be used to maintain the customer base.</li>
<li><em>Decline stage</em> – Little money is spent on the promotional mix as the company tries to phase out the product.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Product characteristics</b> – Three product characteristics guide companies regarding the proper promotional mix:
<ul>
<li><em>Complexity</em> – How much understanding is required to use the product? The more complex the product, the more important personal selling is.</li>
<li><em>Risk (financial, social, and physical)</em> – The greater the risk, the greater the need for personal selling.</li>
<li><em>Ancillary services</em> – How much service and support will be required after the sale? The greater the number of required ancillary services, the more personal selling must be used to convince customers that the company will provide them with good customer service following the purchase.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Stages of the buying decision</b> – The importance of promotional mix elements varies with the 3 stages in the consumer purchase decision:
<ul>
<li><em>Prepurchase stage</em> – Advertising generates awareness, and sales promotion encourages users to try the product.</li>
<li><em>Purchase stage</em> – Personal selling and sales promotion are important, while advertising becomes less so. Direct marketing activities often shorten the time needed to adopt a product or service.</li>
<li><em>Postpurchase stage</em> – Advertising once again becomes important to assure the purchaser that he or she made the right decision. Personal selling may also help to reduce postpurchase anxiety.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Channel strategies</b> – A different emphasis is placed on different promotional mix elements based on whether the manufacturer is using a push or a pull strategy.
<ul>
<li>A <strong>push strategy</strong> involves directing the promotional mix to channel members in order to gain their cooperation in ordering and stocking the product. Personal selling and sales promotions play important roles in encouraging orders and stimulating demand. The manufacturer tries to get channel members to push its goods to their customers by "pushing" the product through the channel.</li>
<li>A <strong>pull strategy</strong> involves directing the promotional mix to ultimate consumers in order to encourage them to ask the retailer for a product. For example, prescription drug companies advertise directly to consumers to get them to ask their doctors about a drug. Thus, direct-to-consumer advertising is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Communication Theory</h1>

<p><strong>Communication</strong> is the process of conveying a message to others. This is the basic communications model. Communications theory rests on four major components: source, message, channel, and receiver. It also depends on several processes.</p>

<p>The <strong>Shannon-Weaver model of communication</strong>, which outlines the steps in the communication process, can be simplified and illustrated as shown:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-11-chapter18-03-shannon-weaver-model.png" alt="Shannon-Weaver communication model diagram showing Source, Encoding, Channel, Decoding, Receiver with Source's field of experience and Receiver's field of experience overlapping, and Feedback loop connecting Response back to Source" class="image-wide-60 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>The major components of this model are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>message</b> is what the source intends to communicate.</li>
<li>The <b>source</b> is the person, group, company, or brand sending the message.</li>
<li>The <b>channel of communication</b> is the medium by which the message is sent.</li>
<li>The <b>receiver</b> is the person or consumer receiving the message (the target market).</li>
<li>The <b>fields of experience</b> of the source and of the receiver include all of the things that each knows and the things they take for granted.</li>
<li><b>Encoding</b> refers to the process in which the source creates the message and, based on the source's field of experience, puts it into terms it believes the receiver will understand.</li>
<li><b>Decoding</b> refers to the method in which the audience perceives and interprets the message.</li>
<li><b>Noise</b> refers to sources of error that cause the distortion of a message in the channel of communication, and it can be involved in encoding, decoding, or both. Some level of noise is inherent and unavoidable in communication, but it can have more of an impact on understanding when the source and the receiver have less overlap in their relative fields of experience.</li>
<li><b>Response</b> refers to the actions receivers take as a result of how they decoded the message. Based on individual understanding of the message, a receiver may have a response of purchasing (or not purchasing) the brand's products or sharing positive (or negative) word of mouth.</li>
<li><b>Feedback</b> is a method of measuring how well the message had the intended response on the receiver. It shows the impact the message had on the receiver's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Feedback can be found through market research, such as monitoring sales. In the <em>feedback loop</em>, firms can adjust their communication process to minimize noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below, we will break down the major components of the basic communications model and discuss how the company can use the aspects that are under its control.</p>

<h1>Source</h1>

<p>Recall that the <strong>source</strong> refers to where the communication originates. We can divide sources into 4 categories based on 2 dimensions:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Personal vs. impersonal</b> refers to whether the source makes direct personal contact:
<ul>
<li>With a <strong>personal</strong> source, there is direct personal contact between the source of the message and its recipient. For example, talking directly to a salesperson is an example of personal contact.</li>
<li><strong>Impersonal</strong> contact is aimed more generally at a group and occurs through some form of mass media, like advertising.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Marketer-controlled vs. independent</b> refers to the relationship of the source to the product at hand:
<ul>
<li>The firm directly controls a <strong>marketer-controlled</strong> source, usually because the firm has paid for it. For instance, marketers have control over all content of the message being communicated in one of their ads.</li>
<li>An <strong>independent</strong> source is one not directly tied to or compensated by the firm. For example, an independent blogger who writes an opinion about a company is an independent source of communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-11-chapter18-04-communication-sources-matrix.png" alt="Matrix showing four types of communication sources: Personal and Marketer-Controlled is Personal Selling (salespeople), Impersonal and Marketer-Controlled is Advertising and Sales Promotion (the company), Personal and Independent is Word of Mouth (friends and family), Impersonal and Independent is Publicity (news media)" class="image-wide-55 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>Consumers tend to trust independent sources more than marketer-controlled sources, and they tend to trust personal sources more than impersonal sources.</p>

<h2>Word of Mouth</h2>

<p><strong>Word of mouth</strong> is communication from consumer to consumer (C2C) about a product or firm. Although word of mouth is not under marketers' direct control, it is still very important. In fact, the independent nature of word of mouth means consumers are more likely to deem it credible. People trust their friends (and often strangers) much more than they trust advertisers.</p>

<p>Additionally, consumers tend to pay more attention to this source of communication because of its personal nature. This is why word of mouth is likely to have the most influence on the decision to purchase a new product.</p>

<h2>Spokespeople</h2>

<p>Companies commonly hire spokespeople to tout their products for them. In many cases, the spokesperson is a <strong>celebrity endorser</strong>—a famous person who may or may not be closely associated with the product. Research has shown that people are more likely to buy products endorsed by someone whom they favor.</p>

<p>A nontraditional tool that is similar to celebrity endorsement is the use of paid influencers. <strong>Influencers</strong> could include internet personalities, people who use the product, or bloggers who write product reviews. (Note that communication from influencers who have not been paid by the company would be considered a personal and independent source similar to word of mouth, whereas communication from a paid influencer is marketer-controlled advertising.)</p>

<p>Influencer marketing is rapidly increasing—even faster than digital advertising. Influencer marketing has become easier due to the creation of new influencer channels and platforms (i.e., online communities and social media), and companies that serve as agents representing influencers. Examples include Vocalpoint, Tremor, and BzzAgent.</p>

<p>Some companies recruit micro-influencers (those with a smaller social media following) because they tend to have stronger relationships with their niche audiences, which is particularly useful if a brand is targeting a small subset of a demographic. For example, Johnson & Johnson enlists teenagers with modest followings to promote brands like Clean & Clear online; J&J marketers believe that kids will respond better to micro-influencers, who are perceived as more authentic.</p>

<p>The 2 basic factors that contribute to the effectiveness of a source in influencing people are the source's credibility and attractiveness.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Credibility</strong> is the extent to which people believe what the source says. It is comprised of two components: expertise and trustworthiness.
<ul>
<li><strong>Expertise</strong> refers to how well the source knows the product they are endorsing. When Tiger Woods endorses a brand of golf clubs, he is seen as having expertise because he has experience as a very successful professional golfer.</li>
<li><strong>Trustworthiness</strong> refers to the extent to which people believe the source's word is unbiased. If it is clear that a celebrity has ulterior motives (such as money) for endorsing a product, consumers will have a difficult time trusting that the spokesperson is expressing their honest opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, Michael Jackson (the "King of Pop") was a spokesperson for Pepsi, but he eventually revealed to the public that he didn't even drink soda (decreasing his expertise), and later, accusations of child sexual abuse decreased his trustworthiness.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Attractiveness</strong> does not necessarily refer only to physical attractiveness; rather, it refers to the endorser's overall attractiveness as an individual (i.e., their likeability or whether the public feels an affinity for them). For example, Michael Jordan is a charismatic role model for kids, which is why he is considered an attractive celebrity endorser—as evidenced by several ads starring Jordan under the tagline, "Be Like Mike."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q Scores</strong> are an industry standard for measuring the consumer appeal (star power) of performers, influencers, brand ambassadors, characters, etc.</p>

<h1>The Message</h1>

<p>Message factors are at the core of promotional strategies. The 3 factors marketers look at when determining how to formulate a message are <em>objectives</em>, <em>strategies</em>, and <em>tactics</em>.</p>

<h2>Determining Objectives</h2>

<p>An <strong>objective</strong> is the basic goal of the firm's promotional campaign. Not all ads are intended to do the same thing, and marketers should clearly identify their objectives before creating the message. One model that is used to determine objectives is the hierarchy of effects model.</p>

<p>The <strong>hierarchy of effects model</strong> proposes that a consumer goes through a series of mental stages when purchasing a product:</p>

<ul>
<li>Becoming aware of the product</li>
<li>Gaining some knowledge of the product</li>
<li>Liking the product</li>
<li>Intending to buy the product</li>
<li>Actually buying the product</li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, there are always more people in the first few stages of the hierarchy than in the last few stages. The marketer's goal is to move consumers through all of the stages so that they make a favorable purchase decision.</p>

<div class="example-box">
<h4>Calculating Hierarchy of Effects</h4>

<p>The following is a depiction of the hierarchy of effects model for WMBT, a radio station:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-11-chapter18-05-hierarchy-effects-funnel.png" alt="Hierarchy of effects funnel diagram showing Total potential market at 100%, Aware at 80%, Knowledge at 75%, Like at 70%, Intend to listen at 60%, and Listen at 52%" class="image-wide-70 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>This diagram illustrates that 80% of the total potential target market is aware of the station, 75% has some knowledge of it, 70% like it, 60% intend to listen within the next week, and 52% actually do listen.</p>

<p>Given this information, what is WMBT's best short-term objective? We will assume that its strategy is to get more people to listen and that this strategy is fixed over the short term. Should WMBT focus on getting more people who intend to listen to actually do so? Should it attempt to make more people aware that it exists? One approach to setting short-term objectives is to calculate the ratio of each group to the next group in the hierarchy and choose the highest ratio to focus on.</p>

<ul>
<p><strong>Total ÷ Aware:</strong> \(100 \div 80 = 1.25\)</p>
<p><strong>Aware ÷ Knowledge:</strong> \(80 \div 75 = 1.07\)</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge ÷ Like:</strong> \(75 \div 70 = 1.07\)</p>
<p><strong>Like ÷ Intend:</strong> \(70 \div 60 = 1.17\)</p>
<p><strong>Intend ÷ Listen:</strong> \(60 \div 52 = 1.15\)</p>
</ul>

<p>Note that this analysis uses the <em>ratio</em> between one stage and the other, not the arithmetic difference. <b>Total ÷ Aware</b> is the largest ratio. Therefore, WMBT should focus its objective on getting more people to be <b>aware</b> of its existence.</p>

<h2>Determining Strategies</h2>

<p>A <strong>strategy</strong> is the general approach an organization uses to achieve its objectives. Strategy is the heart of message formulation. We use the multi-attribute model to make message strategy decisions. In general, a company can use three possible strategies to increase its total weighted rating:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>rating change strategy</strong> typically attempts to increase a brand's rating in consumers' minds.</li>
<li>An <strong>importance weight change strategy</strong> typically attempts to persuade consumers that a particular attribute (the one the brand has a relative advantage in) has a higher importance weight.</li>
<li>The strategy of <strong>adding a new attribute</strong> can involve developing unique and desirable attributes that add value to the product, or emphasizing real (i.e., beneficial) or meaningless product features to differentiate the brand from competitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of message strategy formulation for 3 brands of backpacking tents:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>

</table>

<p>As a review, we multiply the rating for each attribute by that attribute's importance to determine the "score" for that attribute. Then we add the "scores" up for all of the attributes for each brand to find the total weighted rating for each brand.</p>

<p>In this case, we see that Marmot is in the lead, followed by Sierra Designs, followed by North Face. How do we increase the total weighted rating of our product? Recall that the three possible strategies to increase its total weighted rating are a rating change strategy, an importance weight change, or the addition of a new attribute. We will talk about each from the perspective of Sierra Designs.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Rating Change Strategy</b>

<ol>
<li>Start by assuming that you can increase the rating of any attribute to 10 (the highest possible). You make this assumption because you want to find the attribute with the largest potential gain.</li>

<li>Find the maximum change that could occur with respect to any attribute and multiply that change by the importance rating. For example, Sierra Designs' cost rating could go from 9 to 10. Therefore, its "cost" rating could increase by 1. Multiplying by the importance rating of 9, we find that the most we could increase the total weighted rating due to improving the cost attribute's rating is by 9. All of the other rating increases are as follows:
<ul>
<p>Possible Change Due to Improving Cost: \((10 - 9) \times 9 = 9\)</p>
<p>Possible Change Due to Improving Setup: \((10 - 5) \times 8 = 40\)</p>
<p>Possible Change Due to Improving Weight: \((10 - 5) \times 3 = 15\)</p>
<p>Possible Change Due to Improving Durability: \((10 - 8) \times 5 = 10\)</p>
</ul>
<p>Improving the ease of setup rating has the highest potential increase on the total weighted rating.</p>
</li>

<li>We have determined that we should focus our efforts on improving the ease of setup rating. If we could improve the ease of setup rating from 5 to 10, what effect would this have on the overall rating? Would it propel Sierra Designs into the lead?

<p>Yes! As we can see, if Sierra Designs were able to change its ease of setup rating to 10, it would pull into the lead. <b>The point is to increase the attribute that will increase the weighted total the most.</b> When using this strategy, keep in mind that your company's score is the only one affected. This method consists of an attempt to change consumers' perceptions of a firm's product—especially the important attributes.</p>
</li></ol>

<li><b>Importance Weight Change</b>

<p>This strategy attempts to increase the importance weighting of the attributes that have the best ratings. This is where <em>relative</em> differences tend to be more important. To gain market share, you must <b>increase the weights of the attributes that you dominate</b>. This is because a change in importance weighting affects <em>all</em>> of the companies in the market to some degree. This strategy is relatively difficult and is used only sparingly.</p>

<p>For example, Sierra Designs would want to raise the durability attribute importance weighting because it would gain eight points per importance point raised, whereas the other two companies would only gain five points per point raised. Does this help Sierra Designs enough to put it in the lead? The new chart would look like this:</p>

<p>By somehow increasing the importance of durability to 10, Sierra Designs pulled into the lead. This is difficult to do because it involves changing people's priorities.</p>

<p>The difference between changing a factor's importance weighting and changing your company's individual rating for a factor is that all companies could benefit from an increase in an importance weighting. When you change your company's individual ratings, on the other hand, you are the only one who benefits.</p>

<p>A company would never want to increase the importance rating on a dimension that it did not dominate. For example, if Sierra Designs were able to increase the importance rating on weight from 3 to 10, it would gain 35 points, but its competitors would gain even more—63 points each! This is because Sierra Designs' competitors are ranked higher than Sierra Designs in the weight dimension.</p>

<p>In this case, Sierra Designs would benefit by decreasing the importance rating on the weight dimension.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Add a New Attribute</b>

<p>Companies that do not have good strategies to gain overall relative advantage through a rating change or importance weighting change can add a new attribute instead. (New attributes are sometimes called "game changers.") This is the strategy used most often. In this case, Sierra Designs could add the attribute of "venting."</p>

<td style="text-align: center;">5 (× 5 = 25)</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Venting</strong></td>

<td style="text-align: center;">???</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">???</td>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><strong>Total Weighted Rating</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>239</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>???</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>???</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>With the introduction of a new attribute, Sierra Designs can claim that it is the best in the venting category and will benefit from at least some short-term gain. Because this is a new attribute, the competitors will be caught off-guard. Eventually, this attribute will likely just be added to the multi-attribute model. The question marks indicate that we don't know the quality of the venting of the competitors' products yet.</p></li></ul>

<p>This simplified model suggests that some strategies are better than others. For example, changing set-up ease increased Sierra Designs' total score by 40 without impacting the scores of its competitors. In contrast, changing the importance rating for durability increased Sierra Designs' total score by 40 but also increased its competitors' total scores (by 25 for each), causing Sierra Designs to net only a 15-point score increase over competitors.</p>

<p>Different strategies are more difficult (expensive) than others. For example, it is generally easier to change an attribute rating than to change people's importance ratings for an attribute.</p>

<h2>Determining Tactics</h2>

<p>Once a firm has decided on an objective and a strategy, it must determine how to get its message across. <strong>Tactics</strong> refer to specific actions the firm takes to implement the strategy it has chosen for pursuing its objectives.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Setting the promotion budget</b> – How much money will the company spend on the promotional mix? Several methods can be used to establish this budget:
<ul>
<li><strong>Percentage of sales budgeting</strong> involves allocating funds for promotion as a percentage of past or anticipated sales in terms of either dollars or units sold. For example, a budget might be three percent of last year's gross sales.

<p>This method is simple to use, but tying the promotional budget to sales is not always the best idea. Sales may not be the best predictor of the amount or type of promotion needed.</p>

<p>One tool marketers can use to assess the effectiveness of promotion expenditures is the <em>promotion-to-sales ratio</em>, which is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>\[
\text{Promotion-to-sales ratio} = \frac{\text{Total promotion expenditures}}{\text{Total sales}}
\]</p>

<p>A company's yearly promotion-to-sales ratio can be compared to the same company's previous ratios, to competitors' ratios, or to the industry average.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Competitive parity budgeting</strong> (also called <em>matching competitors</em> or <em>share of market budgeting</em>) involves allocating funds to promotion by matching the competitors' absolute level of spending or the proportion per point of market share. This helps "keep up" with competitors, but it should not be the only budgeting tool because competitors may have different promotional objectives.</li>

<li><strong>All-you-can-afford budgeting</strong> involves allocating funds to promotion only after all other budget items are covered. This approach is risky because it ignores promotional objectives and the promotion-sales relationship.</li>

<li><strong>Objective and task budgeting</strong> involves fund allocation whereby the company: (1) determines its promotion objectives, (2) outlines the tasks to accomplish these objectives, and (3) determines the cost of performing these tasks. This form of budgeting incorporates the advantages of the previous techniques, but it can be difficult to determine which tasks are needed to accomplish the objectives.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Selecting the right promotional tools</b> – The right promotional mix tools must be selected and emphasized appropriately. It may be the case that multiple mixes can achieve the same results.</li>

<li><b>Designing the promotion</b> – At this stage, firms create advertisements, make coupons, trade personal selling agents, and write news releases. This step requires the greatest amount of creativity, and each promotional activity must be designed so that it communicates a single, common message. Popular types of appeals that a firm could use are as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Informational</strong> – Informational appeals involve the use of straightforward information about the product to persuade consumers to buy the brand. This is a tactic commonly used for products with knowledgeable consumers and for expensive and high-tech products. It is also used for pharmaceutical drugs, which are legally required to inform consumers of side effects and risks of a medication. Print and internet advertisements are typically best for informational appeals because they provide an opportunity to clearly convey details to the customer.</li>

<li><strong>Comparative</strong> – Comparative appeals make an explicit comparison between the value of the firm's brand and the value of competing brands, in order to show how the firm's brand is superior. Note that firms using this appeal can compare their brand's value to specific products or competitors, or to all competitors in the industry as a whole. When naming specific competitor brands, a firm must be able to substantiate all of its comparative claims with evidence to avoid libel charges.</li>

<li><strong>Image</strong> – Appeals based on image try to associate the brand with a positive image, so that consumers will buy the brand to associate themselves with that image.</li>

<li><strong>Sex appeal</strong> – Sex sells. Sex appeals are widely used in marketing to entice the consumer to buy a product.</li>

<li><strong>Humor</strong> – Humorous appeals use entertainment and/or good feelings to interest consumers in the product. Humor is useful because it grabs a consumer's attention and is more memorable, and funny ads can go viral.</li>

<li><strong>Fear</strong> – These appeals play on some aspect of fear the audience may already have, describing how the product alleviates it. For example, a Subaru commercial used the fear of dying in a car crash to underscore the value of its EyeSight with Lane Keep Assist and Pre-Collision Braking safety feature.

<p>The danger in using fear appeals is arousing the fear but failing to alleviate it. For example, a Nationwide commercial during one Super Bowl did this by making parents fearful that their children might die in an in-home accident. This certainly raised awareness about in-home accidents, but the product—insurance—is hardly something that would make up for the death of a child.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Scheduling the promotion</b> – The next step is to determine when each step of the promotional mix should be introduced. For example, scheduling is critical for movies.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Executing and Assessing the Promotion Program</h1>

<p>Implementing the promotion program can be expensive and time-consuming. There is clearly a trend away from the dedication of departments to specific kinds of promotion. Rather, companies are integrating all forms of promotion into integrated marketing communications programs. This can be difficult; surveys show that lack of expertise, lack of budget, and lack of management approval have caused many IMC programs to fail at implementation. Ideally, the company should engage in pre-testing and post-testing and maintain a database that shows the impact of different promotional tools.</p>

<h1>Direct Marketing</h1>

<p>There are many kinds of direct marketing, including direct mail, catalogs, telemarketing, television, direct selling, direct-response advertising, and interactive or online marketing. There has been significant growth in the use of direct marketing due to companies' emphasis on customer relationship management. The internet, in particular, is one evergrowing source of direct marketing possibilities.</p>

<p>Most marketing campaigns use several direct-marketing methods, including catalogs, email, and telephone calls. Moreover, many campaigns integrate direct-marketing methods with other kinds of promotion.</p>

<p>About half of Americans have ordered something by mail over the past year, and many more have made orders online. Some of the consumer benefits of direct marketing are convenience (ability to shop 24/7 without going in public or having to deal with salespeople), saving money, and fun/entertainment.</p>

<p>The benefit of direct marketing to sellers is that it generates consumer responses, which can take a number of different forms.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Direct orders</strong> are the result of direct marketing offers that contain all the information necessary for prospective buyers to make a purchase decision and complete the transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Lead generation</strong> is the result of a direct marketing offer designed to generate interest in a product or service and a request for additional information.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic generation</strong> is the outcome of a direct marketing offer designed to motivate people to visit a business.</li>
</ul>

<p>Companies keep databases to better target direct marketing. Technology is aiding in the collection of this data without intrusion on customers' privacy. Global technological developments will provide new opportunities for direct marketing.</p>

<p>Privacy concerns are making the ethical issues involved in direct marketing even more important. Many countries, for example, only allow direct marketing to customers who have "opted in" to a company's direct-marketing program. As the internet becomes more and more pervasive in society, it will increasingly be used as a means for direct marketing. This will cause organizations to face additional ethical issues.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the Do Not Call Registry, telemarketing efforts have shifted to direct mail. Proponents of a Do-Not-Mail registry believe that people should be able to block unsolicited mail. Further, a privacy issue is raised due to the website owners who collect information about consumers without consumer consent, resulting in these unsolicited mailings.</p>

<h1>Types of Advertisements</h1>

<p><strong>Advertising</strong> is any paid form of nonpersonal communication about an organization, good, service, or idea by an identified sponsor.</p>

<p>There are 2 types of advertisements: <em>product</em> and <em>institutional</em>.</p>

<h2>Product Advertisements</h2>

<p><strong>Product advertisements</strong> focus on selling a good or service and can take 3 forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Pioneering (or informational) advertisements</strong></em> inform people about what the product is, where it can be bought, and what it can do.</li>

<li><em><strong>Competitive (or persuasive) advertisements</strong></em> tout the brand's strengths and benefits to persuade a buyer to choose that particular brand. A common form of competitive advertising is <em>comparative advertising</em>, which compares one brand's strengths to those of its competitors.</li>

<li><em><strong>Reminder advertisements</strong></em> reinforce previous knowledge. For example, a Valentine's Day ad might remind you to buy flowers or candy for your loved one. A <em>reinforcement</em>, which is a kind of reminder ad, tries to reassure current users that they have made the right choice.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Institutional Advertisements</h2>

<p><strong>Institutional advertisements</strong> are designed to build goodwill or an image for an organization rather than to promote a specific good or service. There are 4 common forms of institutional advertisements:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Advocacy advertisements</em></strong> state the company's position on an issue.</li>

<li><em><strong>Pioneering institutional advertisements</strong></em> state what the company is, where it is located, and what it does.</li>

<li><em><strong>Competitive institutional advertisements</strong></em> promote one product class over another in a competitive market.</li>

<li><em><strong>Reminder institutional advertisements</strong></em> bring the name of the company to the target market's attention once more.</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Advertising Industry</h1>

<p>Within the advertising industry, there are 3 distinct groups:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-exam2-chapter19-20-01-advertising-industry-diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing three overlapping circles labeled Media, Producers (clients), and IMC Firms (ad agencies) representing the advertising industry structure" class="image-right-30 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Producers (clients)</strong></em> – Clients are the product producers that are trying to market their goods and services to ultimate consumers. This includes manufacturers, service providers, and retailers.</li>

<li><strong><em>IMC firms</em></strong> – Integrated marketing communications (IMC) firms are firms that are dedicated to promoting a client's products. This term has replaced the traditional term "advertising agency" to reflect the fact that, in addition to traditional advertising, these firms now also deal with public relations, direct marketing, sales promotion, buying media, internet activities, and related services. There are 3 different kinds of advertising agencies:

<ul>
<li>A <strong>full-service agency</strong> provides the most complete range of services, including digital purchasing, buying influencer time, making a television advertisement, market research, media selection, copy development, artwork, and production. The advertising agencies with the highest revenue worldwide include Accenture, WPP, Publicis Groupe, and Omnicom Group.</li>

<li>A <strong>limited-service agency</strong> (also sometimes called a <em>boutique agency</em>) specializes in one aspect of the advertising process. This agency is compensated by a contractual agreement. A limited-service agency might focus on a specialty like creative services for developing ad content, or it might have expertise in digital or social media advertising, for example.</li>

<li>An <strong>in-house agency</strong> consists of the company's own advertising staff, which may provide full services, or it may provide a limited range of services and outsource other advertising functions. Some large national firms hire advertising professionals in order to have their own, in-house agencies.

<p>Data suggest that the use of in-house agencies is rising along with digital media, as media firms are opening up so that companies wanting to advertise with them don't need an ad agency to do so. In-house agencies also offer advantages including cost efficiencies and quicker turnaround time.</p>

<p>The ad industry is still reeling over a scandal in which IMC firms had been taking kickbacks from the media companies they were buying slots from. This is another reason why firms may want to bring their advertising function in-house.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><em><strong>Media</strong></em> – The media refers to where the client's content is published or what carries the client's promotional message. Television, radio, magazines, websites, newspapers, and billboards are some types of media in which advertisements appear. Both producers and ad agencies can buy advertising time from media companies.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Developing the Advertising Program</h1>

<p>The promotion process we discussed in the previous chapter can be applied to advertising.</p>

<h2>Identifying the Target Audience</h2>

<p>Marketers must understand the demographics, lifestyles, and attitudes of the target market. Ad content, placement, and scheduling may all depend on the characteristics of the target audience, which should be discovered through market research.</p>

<h2>Specifying Advertising Objectives</h2>

<p>The company must decide what it wants the advertisement to do. An advertisement aimed at creating awareness would take a different form than an advertisement aimed at comparing one brand to another. Advertisements perform a number of different functions, including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Inform</em> – Advertising provides basic information to consumers about a product or an issue. For example, the producer of any product or service has to be able to inform potential customers that the brand exists. This is particularly important for new product categories and products during the introduction stage of the product life cycle (PLC).</li>

<li><em>Persuade</em> – Most advertisements intend to persuade consumers to do something, such as perform an action, buy a product, or accept an idea. For example, you may have seen some of the political ads for elections, which are designed to convince you to vote for particular candidates. In this class, we primarily focus on <strong>product advertisements</strong>, which aim to influence someone to purchase a good or service. Companies often focus on the persuasion function during the growth stage of the PLC. Another kind of persuasive advertisement is an <strong>institutional advertisement</strong>, which is not trying to sell the company's product, but, rather, trying to persuade consumers to think more positively about the company. For example, Dr. Cooke played an IKEA ad promoting the company's innovative spirit and willingness to say, "What if?"</li>

<li><em>Sell</em> – One of the most basic functions of advertising is to sell products. Used-car dealerships commonly use a <em>hard-sell approach</em>, which tries to more aggressively grab consumers' attention in attempt to sell products. An example of a <em>soft-sell approach</em> shown in class was Honda's commercial showing a Rube Goldberg machine, which is intended to convey the message that Honda is a master of engineering.</li>

<li><em>Reinforce</em> – In some cases, advertisers want to reinforce purchases that have already taken place. This is particularly relevant for high-priced durables, like automobiles. Automobile manufacturers commonly send promotional materials to consumers after they buy a car to reinforce their decision and keep them happy. Reinforcement makes a customer feel better about the purchase and helps avoid buyer's remorse.</li>

<li><em>Remind</em> – Reminder advertisements attempt to remind people to use a product that they have purchased. The idea is to get the consumer to use up the product they have bought, so that they will have to buy more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting the Advertising Budget</h2>

<p>The company must decide how much of its resources it is willing to devote to the advertising program. Most advertising options are substantial financial commitments and therefore require a formal budgeting process.</p>

<h2>Designing the Advertisement</h2>

<p>Most advertisements contain elements of persuasion and information. Marketers may use many kinds of appeals, including fear appeal, sex appeal, and humorous appeal. Translating a copywriter's idea into an actual ad is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. The cost of designing artwork, layout, and production for an ad can cost as much as $500,000.</p>

<h2>Selecting the Right Media</h2>

<p><em>Advertising media</em> are the different means available to communicate the message to the target audience. Examples include newspapers, radio, magazines, and television. The goals of maximizing exposure and minimizing costs often clash as the advertiser decides which media and which vehicles within those media to use.</p>

<h1>Executing and Assessing the Advertising Program</h1>

<p>To execute the advertising program, the advertiser must pretest the advertising and then actually carry it out.</p>

<p><strong>Pretests</strong> are conducted before advertisements are placed in any medium to determine whether they communicate the intended message or to select from among alternative versions of the advertisement. There are different kinds of pretests:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Portfolio tests</b> analyze copy alternatives by placing the ad among a number of other ads and asking consumers’ impressions of the ads on evaluative scales (e.g., from very informative to not very informative).</li>

<li><b>Jury tests</b> use a panel of consumers to analyze and rate ad copy without having them look at alternative versions of it or other ads.</li>

<li><b>Theater tests</b> are the most sophisticated pretesting type, and they involve showing consumers television shows during which the commercial is shown. Viewers record their feelings about the ads simultaneously through recording devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the advertising program is executed, it must be evaluated to be certain that it is achieving its objectives. <strong>Post-tests</strong> are conducted after an advertisement has been shown to the target audience to determine whether it accomplished its intended purpose. The textbook discusses 5 different kinds of post-tests:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Aided recall</b> – Respondents are provided prompts or cues, such as a list of brand names or advertisements, to help them recall specific ads they have seen.  For example, people might be shown an ad and then asked whether they recall being previously exposed to it and whether it was through reading, viewing, or listening.</li>

<li><b>Unaided recall</b> – People are asked questions such as what ads they remember seeing the previous day without prompting about whether they saw/heard specific advertising messages.</li>

<li><b>Attitude tests</b> – People are asked questions to see whether an advertising campaign has changed their attitudes (e.g., whether they have a more favorable attitude toward the product after the ad campaign).</li>

<li><b>Inquiry tests</b> – Additional product information, product samples, or premiums are offered to an ad’s readers/viewers, and ads that generate the most inquiries are considered the most effective.</li>

<li><b>Sales tests</b> – Studies such as controlled experiments and consumer purchase tests (measuring retail sales resulting from an ad campaign) are used to analyze the effectiveness of individual marketing variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these post-tests are done, advertisers decide whether to make changes to the advertising program (i.e., run it more often, change an element, drop it).</p>

<h1>Three Theories of Advertising</h1>

<p>Three general theories that attempt to describe how advertising works are the hierarchy-of-effects theory, the low-involvement hierarchy, and dual mediation. The hierarchy-of-effects and low-involvement hierarchy theories are older theories; dual mediation theory is a newer theory.</p>

<h2>Hierarchy-of-Effects Theory</h2>

<p>The <strong>hierarchy-of-effects theory</strong> proposes that consumers go through a series of mental or emotional stages as they move from awareness of a product to purchase. These stages can be categorized into 3 groups: <em>cognition</em> (what consumers think about the brand), <em>affect</em> (what consumers feel about the brand), and <em>conation</em> (the actions consumers take).</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-exam2-chapter19-20-02-hierarchy-of-effects-six-stages.png" alt="Diagram showing six stages of hierarchy of effects: 1. Awareness, 2. Knowledge (grouped as Cognition/Think), 3. Liking, 4. Preference (grouped as Affect/Feel), 5. Intent, 6. Purchase (grouped as Conation/Do)" class="image-wide-50 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>First, the consumer discovers the brand (<em>awareness</em>) and subsequently builds <em>knowledge</em> about the brand's features and benefits. Based on this <em>knowledge</em>, the consumer begins to <em>like</em> the product. Subsequently, <em>preference</em> emerges and develops into <em>intent</em> to buy. Finally, the consumer <em>purchases</em> the product.</p>

<p>This <strong>"think-feel-do" process</strong> is called the <em>high-involvement hierarchy of effects</em> because the theory tends to apply best to purchases that are important to the consumer. Examples might include decisions about which car or stereo system to buy.</p>

<h2>Low-Involvement Hierarchy</h2>

<p>As we have discussed previously, not all purchase decisions are equally important to the decision maker. While the "think-feel-do" hierarchy of effects applies to high-involvement purchases, the hierarchy changes a bit for low-involvement purchases, such as purchases of low-price consumer goods like food. This is because the consumer generally purchases a low-involvement good on a trial basis before developing a liking or preference for it. The <strong>low-involvement hierarchy</strong> is as follows:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-exam2-chapter19-20-03-low-involvement-hierarchy-six-stages.png" alt="Diagram showing six stages of low-involvement hierarchy: 1. Awareness, 2. Knowledge (grouped as Cognition/Think), 3. Intent, 4. Purchase (grouped as Conation/Do), 5. Liking, 6. Preference (grouped as Affect/Feel)" class="image-wide-50 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>This <strong>"think-do-feel" process</strong> occurs when the consumer learns enough about the product to know what it does and then simply makes a trial purchase because buying low-involvement products has minimal risk and is the easiest way of evaluating them. Feedback after the purchase allows the consumer to articulate his or her feelings about continued use. Advertisers often use coupons and free samples to get people to try these low-involvement goods.</p>

<h2>Dual Mediation Theory</h2>

<p>More recent research has shown a slightly different relationship between ad liking and brand perceptions. This theory, which is to some extent a combination of the two "end-point" theories of advertising, can be diagrammed as follows:</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-exam2-chapter19-20-04-dual-mediation-flow-diagram.png" alt="Flow diagram showing dual mediation theory with Ad Cognitions and Attitude Toward Ad and Brand Cognitions as mediators between exposure and Brand Attitude leading to Purchase Intention" class="image-wide-90 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<p>According to this theory, two <em>mediators</em> intervene between exposure to advertising and the final purchase. The two mediators in dual mediation are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Attitude toward the ad</em> – Individuals develop an affective sense of whether they like or dislike the ad. People like ads for a number of reasons. For example, an ad may be emotional, humorous, entertaining, or sexy. For low-involvement purchases, a positive attitude toward an ad can directly lead to brand attitude and purchase intention.</li>

<li><em>Brand cognitions</em> – The individual develops some perceptions about the brand because the ad communicated information about brand attributes, brand benefits, user characteristics, and usage situations. Brand cognitions are most important for high-involvement purchases.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that path 2 (brand cognitions) is the <em>central</em> route to persuasion, whereas path 1 (attitude toward the ad) is the <em>peripheral</em> route. A significant component of this model is the idea that ad liking can affect brand attitudes; the more the individual likes the ad, the more he or she will perceive the information in it as truth. Ad liking can play a role in both low-involvement and high-involvement purchases.</p>

<h1>Subliminal Advertising</h1>

<p><strong>Subliminal advertising</strong> is the discrete insertion of images or text into commercials or other forms of advertisement. It is designed to speak to consumers without them being aware of it. People worry about subliminal advertising because subliminal messages manipulate your brain without you knowing it, and you have no defense against them. However, there is still no statistical evidence that subliminal advertising works. Subliminal advertising only occurs below the consumer's threshold of perception (in the subconscious).</p>

<p>The classic example of subliminal advertising occurred in the 1950s, when James Vicary flashed subliminal messages like, "Hungry? Eat popcorn," or, "Thirsty? Drink Coke." on a movie screen in regular intervals for a fraction of a second—so fast that the eye could not see it, even if a person knew what to look for. Vicary originally claimed that the message significantly increased concession sales, and years of marketing research unsuccessfully attempted to replicate this effect. Ultimately, Vicary admitted on his deathbed that he fabricated his data.</p>

<p>In general, three classes of advertising stimuli are considered "subliminal":</p>

<ul>
<li>An <strong>ambiguous stimulus</strong> is identified and interpreted by some but not by others.  For example, Pepsi once (unintentionally) released cans that, when stacked on top of one another, had a design that appeared to resemble the word “SEX,” and it ultimately had to recall over a billion cans.</li>

<li>An <strong>embedded stimulus</strong> is a message that is easily interpreted once it is identified and is intended to be seen. Embedded stimuli are often inserted for a humorous effect or to make the consumer process the ad more carefully. For example, in one ad for M&Ms, green M&Ms spell out the word "DESIRE," but the ad's tagline only reads, "What is it about the green ones?" to make consumers have to work to interpret the stimulus and understand the ad. (The ad is a play on the rumor that green M&Ms are an aphrodisiac.)</p>

<p>Many companies have embedded stimuli in their brand logos. Examples include the depiction of a chicken in the "C" of the Chick-fil-A logo and the two people sharing a chip and dip in the "tit" of the Tostitos logo.<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-exam2-chapter19-20-06-chick-fil-a-tostitos-logos.png" alt="Combined image showing Chick-fil-A logo with chicken shape in the C and Tostitos logo with two people sharing chip and dip" class="image-wide-45 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" /></p>
</li>

<li>A <strong>truly subliminal stimulus</strong> is below the threshold of perception. Subliminal advertising is not illegal, but reputable advertisers voluntarily refrain from using it. In one example shown in class, a viewer found what could be construed as an attempt by McDonald's at subliminal advertising (a flash of the McDonald's logo for a fraction of a second) during an episode of <em>Iron Chef America</em> that could only be seen in frame-by-frame slow motion.</li></ul>
<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Subliminal Stimuli</h4>

<p>Neither ambiguous nor embedded stimuli are truly subliminal. "Subliminal" means that the stimulus is below the threshold of perception.</p>

<h1>Media Strategy</h1>

<p><strong>Media strategy</strong> answers the question, "How do we distribute the ad message effectively?" The following are some key terms that we will encounter when discussing media strategy:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> – A medium is the general category of places or channels in which advertisements can be distributed. Newspapers, television, radio, billboards, and magazines are examples of media.</li>

<li><strong>Media vehicle</strong> – Within each medium are a number of media vehicles—specific instances of the medium. For example, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is a particular media vehicle within the "newspaper" medium, and <em>TheOnion.com</em> is a particular media vehicle within the "internet" medium.</li>

<li><strong>Media mix</strong> – The media mix is the array of media used in an ad campaign. For example, a company's media mix may include television ads, banner ads on the internet, and newspaper ads.</li>

<li><strong>Reach</strong> – The total number of consumers in a target market who are exposed to an advertising campaign at least once in a given time frame is referred to as the <strong>net reach</strong>. Note that net reach does not double-count people; someone who has seen the ad multiple times counts only once. Marketers use net reach to determine the percentage of their target market they have reached at least once. Advertisers aim to maximize reach at minimal cost.</li>

<li><strong>Rating</strong> – Rating refers to the percentage of households in a market that are tuned into a particular TV show or radio station. This is essentially how television or radio stations define their reach.

<p>Nielsen built its reputation on calculating ratings by calling a sample of consumers and asking whether they were watching a given show. With the introduction of DVRs and the ability to record shows and watch them later, Nielsen had to modernize its methods. Several years ago, Nielsen moved to the C3 metric to include people who watched the show within three days of the original airing. Not long after, it began to use a C7 metric. In 2023, the company launched Nielsen One, offering a set of metrics that gives a consistent, comparable, and deduplicated (not double-counting) measure of ads across traditional TV, connected TV, desktop, and mobile devices.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Frequency</strong> – Frequency refers to the average number of exposures per target consumer. It answers the question, "How many times, on average, has the advertising campaign reached an individual in the target market?" Frequency is important because consumers often do not pay attention to an advertisement the first time they see it.
<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: Reach vs. Frequency</h4>

<p>Net reach does not count double exposures, whereas frequency does.</p>
</div>
<p>Most marketers aim for consumers to see an advertisement between 3 and 7 times. Some research indicates that after about 10 exposures, viewers sometimes begin to get annoyed or bored with the ad (ad wear-out), which can have negative effects. Because different people have great differences in the amount and type of media they consume, it can be difficult for marketers to keep them in the "sweet spot" between 3 and 10 exposures.</p>

<p>Digital programmatic advertising could potentially solve this issue if marketers are able to track at the individual level how many times each consumer has viewed a given ad.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gross rating points</strong> – Gross rating points refer to reach (expressed as a percentage of the total market) multiplied by frequency.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Scheduling Strategy</h2>

<p>In order to reach customers efficiently, marketers can choose a timing strategy, which typically follows one of the three basic approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>blitzing</strong> schedule involves a high level of advertising for a period of time (e.g., during the introduction stage), followed by no advertising at all.</li>

<li>A <strong>continuous (steady)</strong> schedule involves running continuous advertisements throughout the year with no regard for seasonal factors. Advertising at constant level is most useful for necessities and other staples for which demand doesn't vary much (e.g., soda, cleaning products).</li>

<li>A <strong>flighting (intermittent)</strong> schedule involves advertising on and off; it alternates between periods of advertising at a set high level and periods of no advertising at a very low level (or no advertising). This strategy is useful for advertising products that have seasonal demand, such as snowboards.</li>

<li>A <strong>pulsing (burst)</strong> schedule essentially combines continuous and flighting; the company generally advertises at some base-line level throughout the year, but it occasionally ramps up its advertising because of demand increases, heavy promotion, or the introduction of a new good or service. For example, a deodorant brand might increase advertising in the summer months. Pulsing is often a particularly suitable strategy for products in the tech industry. For example, software companies tend to use this strategy because they regularly introduce product updates. Some studies have shown that pulsing schedules are the superior scheduling strategy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three factors must be considered when scheduling the advertising:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Buyer turnover</strong> – How often buyers enter the market and buy the product</li>
<li><strong>Purchase frequency</strong> – How frequently customers need to buy the product</li>
<li><strong>Forgetting rate</strong> – How quickly buyers forget the brand in the absence of advertising</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assessing Media Efficiency</h1>

<p>The <strong>cost per thousand</strong> (also called <strong>CPM</strong> because "M" is the Roman numeral for 1,000) is simply the dollar cost of every 1,000 impressions that an ad makes. It can be calculated as follows:</p>

\[
\text{CPM} = \frac{\text{Cost of Ad}}{\frac{\text{# of Impressions}}{1,000}}
\]

<p>Advertisers should not rely exclusively on cost per thousand when choosing a media vehicle because not every impression is on a person in the target audience. The people who see the ad but are not in the target audience are <b>wasted coverage</b>. Clearly, an advertiser would prefer to reach more individuals in the target audience if possible.</p>

<p>The <strong>weighted cost per thousand (wCPM)</strong> is a better metric for assessing the true cost of reaching individuals in the target segment. It reflects the cost of reaching 1,000 individuals <em>in the target audience</em>, and it is calculated as follows:</p>

\[
\text{wCPM} = \frac{\text{Cost of Ad}}{\frac{\text{# of Impressions} \times \text{% of Audience}}{1,000}}
\]

<p>As you can see, the number of impressions is adjusted to reflect only impressions on individuals in the target audience.</p>

<div class="example-box">
<h4>Media Efficiency Example</h4>
    <p><b>Suppose that a company has $50 to spend on an ad, and it can choose between two websites:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>CareerBuilder.com</em> has an audience of 160,000 individuals, and 15% are in the target demographic.</li>
<li><em>CBSSports.com</em> has an audience of 80,000 individuals, and 45% are in the target demographic.</li>
</ul></b>

<p>Let's calculate the simple cost per thousand for each of these media vehicles:</p>

\[
\text{CPM}_{\text{CareerBuilder}} = \frac{\$50}{\frac{160,000}{1,000}} = \$0.31 \quad \text{CPM}_{\text{CBSSports}} = \frac{\$50}{\frac{80,000}{1,000}} = \$0.63
\]

<p>As you can see, the cost per thousand impressions is lower for CareerBuilder.com than for CBSSports.com. (Without knowing the proportion of each site's audience that is in the target demographic, this would lead us to believe that advertising on CareerBuilder.com is more efficient.)</p>

<p>Now, let's calculate the weighted cost per thousand impressions:</p>

\[
\text{wCPM}_{\text{CareerBuilder}} = \frac{\$50}{\frac{160,000 \times 15\%}{1,000}} = \$2.08 \quad \text{wCPM}_{\text{CBSSports}} = \frac{\$50}{\frac{80,000 \times 45\%}{1,000}} = \$1.39
\]

<p>Here, the weighted cost per thousand is lower for CBSSports.com than for CareerBuilder.com. Therefore, it would be more efficient to advertise on CBSSports.com. The ad will reach fewer people overall, but a larger share of the target audience.</p>

<h1>Traditional Media Forms</h1>

<p>The "traditional" forms of media advertising include television, radio, newspaper, magazines, and outdoor advertising (such as billboards).</p>

<h2>Television</h2>

<p>There are 4 categories of television advertising:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Network advertising</strong> refers to advertising that is broadcast to everyone in the nation and can be accessed without a cable box. Examples include ABC, NBC, and CBS. Network television advertising tends to be expensive, and it is purchased through upfronts, in which marketers watch clips from upcoming shows to convince them to advertise during them.</li>

<li><strong>Spot advertising</strong> refers to the small portion of advertisements devoted to local advertisers. Although national advertising dominates the major networks, the local television station is typically given some time for local commercials. Advertisements for local attorneys, auto dealerships, restaurants, and stores are examples of spot advertisements. National companies or political candidates can also target local markets with spot advertising, which is cheaper than network advertising.</li>

<li><strong>Cable advertising</strong> refers to commercials that are played on a cable network, like ESPN. The rising number of cable channels means that this medium is becoming more fragmented. Cable has been expanding at the expense of network television in terms of advertising dollars, because it tends to be cheaper and easier for advertisers to target specific audiences.</li>

<li><strong>Syndicated advertising</strong> includes commercials that are packaged with syndicated programming. For example, advertisements may be packaged with reruns of popular television shows like <em>Friends</em> and <em>Seinfeld</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outdoor</h2>

<p>Traditional <strong>outdoor advertising</strong> includes ads on billboards, subway stations, bus stops, stadium scoreboards, and in movie theaters. In recent years, technology has provided the ability for outdoor advertisements to be updated and digitally enhanced.</p>

<p>Outdoor advertisements have to be short and eye-catching, as they are usually seen while consumers are "on the go." Digital billboards are particularly useful for presenting <em>conditional content</em>—ads based on current events, weather, business conditions, etc.—as well as for displaying public service announcements such as tornado warnings.</p>

<p><em>Place-based media</em> refers to advertisements put in a nontraditional setting, like doctors' offices, theaters, and airports. Ads today can be found in bathrooms, restaurants, elevators, and on gas pumps.</p>

<h2>Radio</h2>

<p>There tend to be consolidated networks of radio stations, and there are very few networks nationwide, so companies often have a similar advertising approach to the radio medium as they do for television. The best-suited ads for radio are short ads, local ads, and ads for concepts that are not complex. Whereas television advertising is often purchased in mass, radio advertising can be purchased more sporadically, so it can be used to advertise for things more timely or episodic in nature (such as an upcoming event).</p>

<h2>Newspapers</h2>

<p>Newspapers were once important media vehicles, but their importance is declining. However, newspapers can be useful for local advertisements, time-sensitive advertisements, and ads that want to give more detailed information.</p>

<h2>Magazines</h2>

<p>Magazines are less useful than newspapers for advertising that is time-based for a short-term event, since they are distributed less frequently. However, this can be a benefit because magazines are often left for long periods of time in places like doctor's offices, where they can be read for months after publication. Additionally, magazines can provide information more evocatively, and they often have niche audiences.</p>

<h1>Digital Media and New Media Forms</h1>

<p>The general trend is away from traditional media, in favor of digital and online advertising.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of Digital Advertising</h2>

<p>Digital ads offer advantages such as targeted advertising, efficiency through programmatic advertising, and easy measurement. <strong>Behavioral targeting</strong> involves marketing to specific consumers on the basis of their behavior. Online shopping behaviors can be tracked and used to trigger relevant ads on websites the individual visits in the future. Advertisers can buy display ads from a syndicate, which bids on display ads from a number of media outlets and then narrowly targets consumers using data from their web history.</p>

<p>With behavioral targeting, <strong>programmatic advertising</strong> can reach a narrow segment of customers with particular characteristics. If you are identified as an attractive consumer for exposure to a particular programmatic ad, you may repeatedly see the same ad on various sites because many bigger sites use the same underlying ad networks.</p>

<p><strong>Contextual targeting</strong> involves marketing to consumers on the basis of the internet content (commonly editorial content) that the individual views (e.g., ads next to content of a particular category or containing a particular keyword). However, this sometimes results in inappropriate ad placement (sometimes called a brand safety failure). For example, a Toyota ad was placed with an article about a teacher who was hit by a car, and an American Airlines "We know why you fly" ad was placed next to an article about a fatal skydiving accident.</p>

<p>Some disadvantages of online advertising are long load times, inconsistent technical standards, and uncertainty as to their effectiveness. The following are additional concerns specific to digital media advertising:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Mismeasurement</em></b> – Software programs like click bots can be used for <strong>ad fraud</strong>, which uses automation to fake traffic and make ads seem more successful than they truly are. Digital advertising also presents potential for unintentional mismeasurement. For example, Facebook has struggled with revelations that it was overstating its ads' effectiveness.

<p>A related problem is <strong>click fraud</strong>, which occurs when a person or a software program deceptively clicks on an ad numerous times so that the advertiser has to pay the host site more. Estimates are that click fraud may cost advertisers as much as $6.5 billion per year.</p>
</li>

<li><em><b>Ad blockers</em></b> – Google has been collaborating with various large marketers, ad agencies, industry groups, and publishers to create the Coalition for Better Ads, which attempts to create ad standards in order to fix the problems with online advertising that drive consumers to install ad blockers.</li>

<li><em><b>The death of third-party cookies</b></em> – Some consumers are concerned about online data collection and privacy issues related to cookies. <strong>First-party cookies</strong> are created by the website the user is visiting, whereas <strong>third-party cookies</strong> were created by other websites. Third-party cookies are used by marketers to collect information (such as expressed preferences and personal data) on visitors of the site their ad appears on, which enables behavioral targeting. Safari and Firefox have blocked third-party cookies by default, and Google Chrome has introduced features to help users make informed choices about third-party cookies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Display Ads and Search Ads</h2>

<p>The largest categories of digital advertising are display ads and search ads.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Display ads</strong> include video, banner ads, rich media, and sponsorships. Rich media is typically some form of interactive media that can include video or audio and is more immersive than standard static banner advertisements (e.g., interactive ads that feature drop-down menus, games, or search engines).</li>

<li><strong>Search ads</strong>, previously the dominant form of digital advertising, are sponsored links on search engines such as Google. Google is by far the market share leader in internet search. Advertisers bid in real-time on the right to have their link show up (with the small Ad designation next to it) when consumers search particular terms. Search ads are popular among advertisers because they are still very effective.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr. Cooke noted that the rise of AI agents is disrupting traditional online search and shopping, as buyers increasingly rely on search powered by generative AI. In fact, 80% of consumers use zero-click results for 40% of their searches, which has led to a 30% drop in traffic to many company websites and an increase in AI referral traffic. Some marketers are trying to establish direct relationships with AI model developers, while others are exploring Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) by working to optimize content for AI discovery. However, AI models and their behaviors are constantly evolving, so marketers still face uncertainty about how to influence the way their products appear in AI-driven searches.</p>

<h2>Mobile</h2>

<p>Marketers are increasingly using <strong>mobile marketing</strong>—marketing activity conducted on internet networks that consumers connect to with their mobile devices. Mobile advertising has blossomed in recent years and is continuing to grow steadily.</p>

<p>Mobile marketing is attractive due to the availability of personalization, similar to computer internet advertising, but it has the benefit of allowing companies to identify the specific person using the device (as opposed to a desktop computer, which can have multiple regular users), and it often provides location data. With mobile advertising, marketers can show promotional messages that are triggered by a consumer's physical location, based on information from the GPS of his or her mobile device or with mobile beacons.</p>

<p>Additionally, mobile devices have created a new form of advertising, as companies can create their own apps for consumers to download and interact with, or they can purchase opportunities to advertise on an existing app or game. Three types of apps that use mobile marketing and are currently on the rise are price-comparison searches, loyalty programs, and promotions based on location.</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>Response rates, and even open rates, are very low for a lot of email marketing, but <strong>email ads</strong> are cheap to distribute and thus account for the vast majority of email. There are 2 basic kinds of <b>permission marketing</b> through email: opt-in and opt-out. <strong>Opt-in</strong> requires the consumer to physically click the box and give permission to the company to send promotional emails. In contrast, the permission boxes are already clicked in <strong>opt-out</strong> marketing, and consumers have to unclick them to withdraw permission. Emails to which customers have opted-in are much more likely to be opened and have much higher response rates (clicks on the links inside the emails).</p>

<h2>Social Media</h2>

<p>Social media sites are attractive to advertisers due to the data they have collected about each person with an account, which is useful for demographic and behavioral targeting, and advertising spending on social media is projected to continue to increase. The goal of social media advertising is engagement and creating a dialogue with the consumer, so marketers must be nimble, mobile, and have staff dedicated to it.</p>

<p>There are several factors to consider when defining social media:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Definition</em> – <strong>Social media</strong> can be loosely defined as online media where users can submit photos, videos, comments, and feedback on various topics. A <em>social network</em> refers to a single social media site, like Facebook.</li>

<li><em>Origins</em> – The rise of social media is oftentimes seen as being synonymous with the advent of "Web 2.0," a new form of the World Wide Web that allowed content to be updated and revised by multiple authors. Web 3.0 will take this one step further, with messages that are customized to each user's interests, needs, activities, and locations.

<p><strong>User-generated content (UGC)</strong> is a general term covering publicly available online media created by end users. UGC is posted on a publicly accessible website or social networking site, demonstrates creative effort, and is generated by an individual consumer outside of an organization.</p>
</li>

<li><em>Classification</em> – Researchers Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein proposed a system in which social media are classified on the basis of two factors:

<ul>
<li><em>Media richness</em> – Media richness refers to the degree of communication between two parties. A higher degree of media richness signifies that the parties have a greater social influence on one another. Face-to-face communication has high media richness. E-mail, on the other hand, has low media richness.</li>

<li><em>Self-disclosure</em> – In most cases, individuals want to make a favorable impression of themselves to others through social media. Certain types of social media allow for more disclosure than others. A higher degree of self-disclosure tends to increase the influence on those reached.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Important ways that social media changed marketing are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social media have prompted the rise of <strong>influencer marketing</strong>, which entails the recruitment of influencers to endorse a company's products, often for compensation (as opposed to focusing on prospective customers). On a range from micro to macro, influencers are identified based on how many followers they have amassed; the bigger the follower base, the more likely people are to perceive an influencer as trustworthy. The most effective influencers are those who include authentic stories and high-quality visuals in their product endorsements.</li>

<li>Social media formed the playing field for <em>social commerce</em> and <em>social shopping</em>. <strong>Social commerce</strong> involves using social media to browse and buy online without going to a company's website (i.e., using a social network to make an e-commerce transaction). <strong>Social shopping</strong> involves using social media to share recent purchases, deals, coupons, product reviews, and other shopping finds with friends and contacts. While social commerce tends to emphasize the seller and transactions, social shopping emphasizes the customer experience. <em>Social proof</em>, the concept that people take up the behaviors of others they believe are similar, explains why social shopping is such a success.</li>
</ul>

<div class="other-box">
<h4>Retail Media</h4>

<p>Retail media networks attempt to leverage consumers' identification with particular retailers by offering digital ad space on their websites to manufacturers (regardless of whether they sell their products through the retailer). Amazon has been the leader in this trend, which is rapidly growing. Retail media is referred to as the third wave of digital advertising (the first wave was search, and the second wave was social media).</p>
</div>

<h1>Integrating Social Media into Marketing Strategies</h1>

<p>A <strong>social media marketing program</strong> is the portion of a company's integrated marketing communications effort dedicated to producing content for social media that garners the attention of users, thereby persuading them to share that content and thus influence others to engage with the brand or message.</p>

<p>With social media, companies aim to have the message continue past the receiver. Positive word-of-mouth is the goal, and companies hope that this will spread quickly through the social network. The success of a social media marketing program relies on <strong>customer engagement</strong>—the extent of customer interactions with a brand on social media.</p>

<h2>Selecting the Social Network</h2>

<p>There are a couple of factors brand managers need to assess when selecting a social network:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Available audience data</em> – Google and other services allow companies to view user demographics for each social networking site.</li>
<li><em>Recent growth</em> – Companies are interested in the number of users and the market share of social network site visits.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Selecting the Social Media Content</h2>

<p><strong>Social media content</strong> is the information and experience that are directed toward and end user or audience. Companies use seven types of social media content to generate customer engagement:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Educational content</em> includes infographics, FAQs, tips, and how-to posts.</li>
<li><em>Inspirational content</em> includes quotes, facts or trivia, uplifting stories, and inspirational images.</li>
<li><em>Interactive content</em> includes quizzes, games, polls, virtual reality, and contents.</li>
<li><em>Connecting content</em> includes stories, behind-the-scenes images, and posts thanking fans or soliciting feedback.</li>
<li><em>Promotional content</em> includes coupons, promotions, discounts, customer testimonials, and webinars.</li>
<li><em>Newsworthy content</em> includes recent developments of a brand and relevant coverage of information relating to the product or industry.</li>
<li><em>Entertaining content</em> includes viral videos, jokes, comics, and puzzles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Measuring the Results of Social Media Programs</h2>

<p>Metrics used to measure the results of a social media program include those related inputs/costs and outputs/revenues.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Inputs or costs</em> – There are a number of measures linked to inputs or costs. Negotiated performance measures involve paying the site to display an ad for a certain amount of time. The cost per thousand (CPM) and cost per click (CPC) measure the cost relative to how many users saw the ad and how many clicked on it, respectively. The cost per action (CPA) measure is tied to actual sales revenues.</li>

<li><em>Outputs or revenues</em> – The measures managers frequently use that relate to outputs or revenues include fans, share of voice, page views, visitors (total and unique) to a page, average page views per visitor, interaction rate (i.e., the number of people who interacted with a post divided by total number of viewers), click-through rate (percentage of viewers who clicked on a page), and fan sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today's use of marketing in social media is sometimes referred to as a <em>smart system</em> that combines the real and digital worlds. Many people have noticed that the line between our physical and virtual worlds is blurring. Several technologies help explain this real world-digital world convergence:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Social commerce technologies</em> – Social media is changing how companies engage consumers and how consumers shop and pay for products.</li>

<li><em>Databases and algorithms</em> – Finding prospective customers involves the use of algorithms for searching databases. For example, Facebook allows users to see pages their friends have "liked," which shows advertisers the real value of likes on sites.</li>

<li><em>Apps</em> – <strong>Apps</strong> are small software programs that can be downloaded and used on smartphone and tablet devices. The Apple App Store currently offers over 2.2 million apps, and Google Play offers over 3 million. Examples of highly successful apps include Angry Birds, Candy Crush Saga, and Pokémon Go.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the convergence of physical and virtual worlds is convenient for consumers, there are some disadvantages such as interfering with personal privacy. Many users are concerned that social networks have access to a lot of data from their users (such as browsing histories, financial information, and location), which they sell to third parties for marketing purposes. There is a lot of debate currently over how much "convergence" is too much.</p>

<h1>Sales Promotion</h1>

<p><strong>Sales promotion</strong> is one of the basic elements of the promotional mix, which is intended to generate short-term sales growth. Goals of sales promotion include ROI tracking, increasing sales of commodities, creating purchase incentives, prompting brand switching, and increasing market share. Sales promotion accounts for $85 billion in company expenditures annually. The trend is toward promotion programs with a variety of promotional elements. The textbook places sales promotion in two groups: consumer-oriented and trade-oriented.</p>

<h2>Consumer-Oriented Sales Promotions</h2>

<p><strong>Consumer-oriented sales promotions</strong> (or <em>consumer promotions</em>) are sales tools used to support a company's advertising and personal selling directed to ultimate consumers. They include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Coupons</em></b> – Allowing the customer to buy items at a discounted price, which encourages them to try new products. Most consumers use coupons, and $400 billion worth of coupons are distributed in the United States annually. Most coupons are found in newspaper inserts, but an increasing number of coupons are being offered online.

<p>While coupons do increase market share right after they are distributed, they also reduce revenues by lowering the price for already-loyal customers. Coupons can be expensive to distribute, handle, and redeem.</p>
</li>

<li><em><b>Deals</em></b> – Short-term price reductions that increase trial use among potential customers or retaliate against the actions of a competitor. For example, if Company A introduces a new kind of cake mix, Company B might offer a "2 cake mixes for the price of 1" deal.</li>

<li><em><b>Premiums</em></b> – Offering merchandise for free or at significant retail savings. For example, McDonald's gave out collectible toys from the movie <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> with the purchase of a Happy Meal.</li>

<li><em><b>Contests</em></b> – Allowing consumers to win a prize by using their analytical and creative thinking skills. For example, Kellogg's "Pringles Mystery Flavor Contest" gave people the opportunity to guess the new flavor of Pringles chips.</li>

<li><em><b>Sweepstakes</em></b> – Entering participants in a game of chance that does not involve analytical ability or creative thinking. Two forms of sweepstakes are becoming increasingly popular. The first offers products as prizes. For example, Mars Chocolate offered a sweepstakes in which customers could win a car. The second offers experiences as prizes. For example, <em>The Voice</em> offers a sweepstakes in which concert attendees can win a trip to the season finale of the <em>The Voice</em> television show. Federal laws regulate the operation of sweepstakes.</li>

<li><em><b>Samples</em></b> – Offering a product either for free or at a greatly reduced price, usually in a smaller trial size. For example, Taco Bell and Ben & Jerry's frequently give away food.</li>

<li><em><b>Loyalty programs</b></em> – Encouraging repeat purchases by offering a premium along with the accumulation of purchases. Popular examples are frequent-flyer programs, grocery store frequent-shopper cards, and credit card reward programs. On average, each household in the U.S. belongs to 29 such programs.</li>

<li><em><b>Point-of-purchase displays</b></em> – Product displays that act as an advertisement, commonly hold the product itself, and are located in high-traffic areas in stores (e.g., cardboard stands at the end of store aisles). These are important because one-third of grocery purchase decisions are made in the store. Grocery stores increasingly use scent, sound, and animation to entice consumers to buy certain goods.</li>

<li><em><b>Rebates</b></em> – Offers to return money based on proof of purchase. Consumers are less likely to take advantage of rebates for lower-priced items.</li>

<li><em><b>Product placement</b></em> – Product placement involves the use of a brand-name product in a movie, television show, video, or commercial for another product.

<p>A <em><b>reverse product placement</b></em> occurs when a fictional product is brought to the marketplace. For example, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurant chain emerged from the fictional company featured in the movie <em>Forrest Gump</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Consumer promotions are generally thought of as <strong><em>pull</em> promotions</strong>, as the consumer is given an incentive—such as a coupon—to pursue the product. The consumer demands the product from the retailer, who must then request the product from the distributor. That is, consumer demand pulls the product through the channel.</p>

<img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-exam2-chapter19-20-07-pull-promotion-flow-diagram.png" alt="Flow diagram showing pull promotion with Manufacturer connected to Retailer connected to Consumer, with Coupons flowing from top, and Pull arrows pointing from Consumer back through the channel" class="image-wide-60 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />

<h2>Trade-Oriented Sales Promotions</h2>

<p><strong>Trade-oriented sales promotions</strong> (or <em>trade promotions</em>) are sales tools used to support a company's advertising and personal selling directed to wholesalers, distributors, or retailers. They include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><b>Allowances and discounts</em></b> – These are used to maintain or increase inventory levels in distribution channels. However, overuse of allowances and discounts causes channel members to change their ordering patterns in anticipation of the discounts or allowances. <em>Trade allowances</em> offer middlemen discounts or additional product in return for them achieving higher sales of the product. There are 3 types of allowances:

<ul>
<li><em>Merchandise allowance</em> – Reimbursing a retailer for special featuring of the brand. For example, a coupon may be placed in a newspaper. For each coupon that the retailer gives to the producer, the retailer gets a certain allowance.</li>

<li><em>Case allowance</em> – Discounts on each case ordered during a specified time period. For example, 10 percent might be deducted off the invoice. Alternatively, one in 10 cases might be free.</li>

<li><em>Finance allowance</em> – Reimbursing retailers for financing costs and consumer sales promotions costs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <em>trade shows</em> are intended to increase distributors' awareness of a product and improve sales techniques in the channel.</p>
</li>

<li><em><b>Cooperative advertising</b></em> – This refers to advertising programs in which a manufacturer pays a percentage of the retailer's local advertising expense when the retailer advertises the manufacturer's products. In addition, the manufacturer often gives the retailer a number of pre-produced ads that can be used in different media. <em>Co-op advertising</em> offers to make it easier for the retailer to advertise by designing canned ads that the retailer can use, in exchange for sharing the advertising costs. These are very common in fast-moving product categories, such as groceries, which often generate weekly flyers for customers.</li>

<li><em><b>Training of distributors' sales force</b></em> – A manufacturer depends on the reseller having competent salespeople to represent its products. Thus, the manufacturer may wish to help train the reseller's sales force. Manufacturers may also provide incentives and recognition to serve as motivation for the reseller's salespeople (e.g., <em>dealer contests</em> that reward retailers who sell the most product).</li>
</ul>

<p>Trade promotions are thought of as <strong><em>push</em> promotions</strong>, and they go from the manufacturer to the retailer. Manufacturers give retailers incentives to sell large amounts of the product. For example, manufacturers may offer a "case discount" or "quantity discount" in which the retailer gets a discount when it buys a whole case of a good. The retailers then use promotional activities to push the product to the consumer.</p>

<h2>Trends in Sales Promotion</h2>

<p>Usage of sales promotions is increasing, with companies devoting a larger share of their budget to it. One reason for increases in sales promotion is <em>growing retailer power</em>, which makes a manufacturer want to provide incentives for retailers to favor its brand in their shelf space.</p>

<p>Additionally, <em>increased promotion sensitivity</em> has made people more eager to get discounts. Moreover, <em>brand proliferation</em> has resulted in <em>ad clutter</em>, which divides consumers' attention. When it's more difficult to get consumers to see ads, companies increase sales promotion to try to pick up the slack. Finally, companies have been <em>focusing on the short-term</em> to get revenue, as CEOs are requiring more justification for large marketing budgets.</p>

<h1>Public Relations</h1>

<p><strong>Public relations</strong> is a form of communication management that seeks to influence the feelings, opinions, or beliefs held by customers, prospective customers, stockholders, suppliers, employees, and others about a company and its products or services. The most commonly used public relations tool is publicity.</p>

<p><strong>Publicity tools</strong> refer to methods of obtaining a nonpersonal presentation of an organization, good, or service without direct cost. Some important publicity tools are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>News releases</em> – Announcements about changes in the company or the product line, which are sent to newspapers, radio stations, or other media outlets as an idea for a story.</li>

<li><em>News conferences</em> – An informational meeting for representatives of the media. These are particularly useful for responding to negative publicity.</li>

<li><em>Public service announcements (PSAs)</em> – Free time or space that the media donate to a nonprofit organization.</li>

<li><em>Personal activities</em> – The use of individuals to create visibility for a company, through activities that affect public perceptions.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Increasing the Value of Promotion</h1>

<p>Promotion has been adjusted to increase customer intimacy through an emphasis on long-term relationships and an increase in self-regulation.</p>

<h2>Building Long-Term Relationships with Promotion</h2>

<p>Promotion that engages customers in entertaining communication can increase brand and store loyalty. The internet presents a great opportunity for companies to engage in personal communication with customers through promotions. However, customers' privacy interests must be considered when engaging in this type of activity.</p>

<p>The trend is to combine advertising, public relations, direct marketing, and promotion into an integrated campaign, thus rendering traditional advertising firms "communications consulting firms." Multimedia and interactive approaches are becoming more important in an increasingly global and diverse world.</p>

<h2>Self-Regulation</h2>

<p>Customers are sometimes misled by promotions—particularly promotions aimed at the elderly or children. Some people believe that more government regulation is needed to curb misleading promotions. However, this would be expensive. Thus, advertisers are increasingly engaging in <em>self-regulation</em>—imposing heightened ethical standards on themselves. As self-regulation proliferates, ethical decision making by marketers becomes more important.</p>


<h1>The Importance of Personal Selling</h1>

<p><strong>Personal selling</strong> involves the two-way flow of communication between a buyer and seller, often in a face-to-face encounter designed to influence a person or group's purchase decision. Personal selling makes up a large portion of the IMC budget. Personal selling is about building long-term relationships, especially as an organization matures. Notwithstanding the increase in technology that has made personal selling easier, it remains human-intensive. <strong>Sales management</strong> involves planning a selling program and implementing and controlling the personal selling effort of the firm. Additionally, <em>professional selling</em> is primarily used in a B2B context and follows a sales process that is not always sequential.</p>

<p>Personal selling is sometimes called the "backbone of the promotional mix" because it is so important. Selling is at the heart of marketing and, arguably, at the heart of the worldwide economic system. Companies spend more money on personal selling than on any other aspect of the promotional mix because it provides a high return on investment. Salespeople learn the needs of the customer, which is necessary for success in business. Personal selling plays 3 roles in a firm's marketing effort:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Salespeople link the firm to its customers.</li>
    <li>To the customer, salespeople <em>are</em> the company.</li>
    <li>Personal selling may be dominant in the overall marketing program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Virtually every job involves some form of personal selling. Selling can be a career path, or it can be a stepping-stone to higher management positions. Even people in non-sales jobs (such as finance) spend a lot of their time selling something. More than half of the people who enter marketing as a career begin with a sales position.</p>

<p>Public perception of salespeople is not particularly positive. A common stereotype is that sales isn't a legitimate career because "anyone can do sales." In reality, selling requires an understanding of the product, the needs of the customer, and how they fit together. On the other hand, some people believe that personal selling is something people have to "be born to do" or "have in their blood." This notion is also not entirely true, as learning about personal selling can make someone a better salesperson.</p>

<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are over 13 million sales jobs in the U.S. In terms of numbers of people, the following are the most common sales positions:</p>

<table>

        <td>Retail sales</td>

    </tr>
</table>

<h1>Forms of Personal Selling</h1>

<p>A firm can use any combination of three different kinds of personal selling: <em>order taking</em>, <em>order getting</em>, and <em>customer sales support activities</em>.</p>

<ul>
    <li>An <strong>order taker</strong> processes routine orders or reorders for products that the company has already sold. There are generally two types of order takers. <b>Inside order takers</b> (also called <b>order clerks</b> or <b>salesclerks</b>) complete transactions with customers by answering simple questions and taking orders (e.g., through inbound telemarketing). <b>Outside order takers</b> go to customers and replenish resellers' inventory stocks.</li>
    
    <li>An <strong>order getter</strong> sells in a conventional sense, identifying prospective customers, providing them with information, persuading them to buy, closing sales, and following up on customers' use of a product or service. Order getters must have a lot of training, product knowledge, and people skills. This is typically an expensive endeavor, and order getters usually work long hours. The exception is <b>outbound telemarketing</b>, which is the practice of contacting current and prospective customers by using a telephone rather than a personal visit.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Customer sales support personnel</strong> provide various services that augment the selling effort.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Missionary salespeople</strong> do not directly solicit orders but rather concentrate on performing promotional activities and introducing new products. For example, pharmaceutical representatives try to get doctors to prescribe their drugs through indirect promotional activities.</li>
            
            <li>A <strong>sales engineer</strong> is a salesperson who specializes in identifying, analyzing, and solving customer problems. This person brings technical expertise to the selling situation but often does not actually sell products and services.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Team selling</strong> refers to using an entire team of professionals to sell to and service major customers. A sales team might consist of a salesperson, a sales engineer, a service representative, and a financial executive, for example.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Conference selling</strong> involves a salesperson and other resource people meeting with buyers to discuss problems and opportunities.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Seminar selling</strong> involves a company team conducting an educational program for a target company's technical staff, aimed at selling a product or service.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>The Selling Process</h1>

<p>The selling process can be described in six stages: (1) <em>prospecting</em>, (2) <em>pre-approach</em>, (3) <em>approach</em>, (4) <em>presentation</em>, (5) <em>close</em>, and (6) <em>follow-up</em>.</p>

<div class="exam-tip">
<h4>EXAM TIP: The Selling Process</h4>
<p>Be familiar with what happens during each stage of the selling process.</p>
</div>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Prospecting</strong> refers to the search for and qualification of potential customers (or <em>prospects</em>). Prospecting involves two major steps:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Finding leads</em> – A <em>lead</em> is a person or company that might be interested in the product the salesperson is trying to sell. A salesperson might find leads by going to trade shows or conferences, purchasing lists of leads, or advertising. Social selling refers to using websites, e-mail, and social networks, and cold canvassing refers to contacting an individual or business in a directory. The refusal rate is high, but cold canvassing can be successful. Another way to find leads in a business-to-business transaction is to use the NAICS system.</li>
            
            <li><em>Qualifying prospects</em> – Once the salesperson has identified a lead, he or she must determine whether the lead is a good prospect. To turn a lead into a prospect, a salesperson must be able to establish the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>The lead has a need or a want for the product.</em> The lead should actually have an interest in the product.</li>
                    <li><em>The lead is able to purchase the product.</em> That is, the lead can afford it.</li>
                    <li><em>The lead has the authority to purchase the product.</em> This means the lead can make purchase decisions. Purchase authority is especially important in an organizational setting; only specific people in any organization actually have the authority to make certain purchases.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>The <strong>pre-approach</strong> refers to the planning that occurs before the sales call. The keys to a successful pre-approach are as follows:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Gathering information</em> – The salesperson must gather as much information as possible and decide what the best approach will be before attempting to make the sale. For example, a salesperson would want to gather information about a company, its industry, and its customers. The salesperson might also want to gather information about the person who they will be meeting.</li>
            
            <li><em>Setting sales call goals</em> – The salesperson must decide what he or she wants to accomplish during the sales call.</li>
            
            <li><em>Prepare a presentation</em> – Finally, the salesperson must prepare a presentation aimed at accomplishing those sales goals. Preparing the presentation requires <strong>practice, practice, practice!</strong> This doesn't mean that you need to completely memorize your presentation, but just that you are fully prepared.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>The <strong>approach</strong> is the stage during which the salesperson secures the opportunity to begin presenting his or her pitch. This involves having the initial meeting with the prospect, gaining the prospect's attention, stimulating interest, and building a foundation for the sales presentation itself. Focus on the following:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Making a good first impression</em> – This involves looking the part and conducting yourself appropriately. You want the prospect to want to spend time with you.</li>
            
            <li><em>Building rapport by finding points of commonality</em> – You might do research before the meeting to learn something about the prospect, such as a mutual personal interest, to bring up in small talk.</li>
            
            <li><em>Asking questions and listening to the answers</em> – Don't ask questions just for the sake of asking them. Ask questions whose answers you are genuinely interested in, and actively listen to the response.</li>
            
            <li><em>Discovering customer needs</em> – Listening helps a salesperson discover a customer's current and potential needs. The better job a salesperson does at listening, the better he or she is able to discover customer needs, and the more likely he or she will be to make a sale.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>The <strong>presentation</strong> (sometimes called the "pitch") is the heart of the selling process, during which the salesperson tells the prospect what he or she has to offer. Its objective is to convert a prospect into a customer by creating a desire for the product or service. When presenting a product, be sure to do the following:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Determine the appropriate presentation format</em> – The salesperson must have figured out which visual aids, such as a PowerPoint, laptop, product sample, or handout, to have available during the presentation. In general, a presentation follows one of the following major formats: canned, outlined, adaptive, or consultative.
                
                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>"Canned" formats (formula selling)</strong> refers to approaches that require little creativity on the part of the marketer. The salesperson follows a preset script in every selling situation. As a result, these formats are typically used by low-level sales forces and unprofessional salespeople. Three examples of canned selling formats are as follows:
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Ingratiation</b> – Attempting to make the prospect more receptive by giving him or her compliments, also known as "brownnosing" or "false flattery."</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Foot-in-the-door</b> – Making a small request, and then following it up with a larger request. People are more likely to accede to a large request when they have agreed to a small request beforehand. (This approach relies on the momentum from the first "yes.") For example, someone might ask you to sign a petition (i.e., luring you in with a simple, reasonable request) and then, once you agree, ask for a donation (i.e., make the sales proposition).</li>
                            
                            <li><b>Door-in-the-face</b> – Making a large request that you know won't be granted before making a smaller, more reasonable request. (This approach relies on the guilt that a person feels after saying no to the first request.) Dr. Cooke showed a comic strip where Calvin first asks his mom if he can set fire to his bed, then if he can ride his tricycle on the roof, and finally, if he can simply have a cookie.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Outlined presentations</strong> are similar to the "canned" approach; however, the salesperson does not have everything memorized. The salesperson has a set of points to go through (i.e., an outline of the presentation), and they will hit on each of these at some point in the presentation. This approach allows for a little more spontaneity, but it is still relatively consistent and inflexible when it comes to the points to be made.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Adaptive selling</strong> involves listening to the wants and needs of the markets before making a sales presentation. The adaptive selling format is closely related to the <em>marketing orientation</em>, and the technique requires a skilled, trusted sales force that can make wise decisions. This builds trust because it demonstrates that the salesperson is genuinely listening to the buyer's needs.
                        
                        <p>The 2 steps in adaptive selling are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Determine customer needs and perceptions.</li>
                            <li>Devise strategies to satisfy customer needs.</li>
                        
    </li>
</ol>

<div class="example-box">
    <h4>The Importance of Listening</h4>
    
    <img src="https://smokinnotes.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/public/mar3023-253-exam2-chapter21-01-listening-talking-graph.png" alt="graph showing listening and talking percentages over time during a sales call" class="image-right-30 content-image" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" />
    
    <p>The graph to the right shows what an <em>adaptive salesperson</em> does. He or she starts a sales call by spending a lot more time listening than talking. The listening is done purposefully, to learn the needs of the customer. It is only after the salesperson discovers those needs that he or she begins to listen less and talk more.</p>
</div>

<p>With the adaptive selling format, salespeople can use the multi-attribute model to improve selling. A salesperson might even ask a prospective customer to fill out a survey in order to learn more about the customer's perceptions of the brand (or other brands), as well as the customer's importance ratings on various attributes.</p>

    <li><strong>Consultative selling</strong> focuses on problem identification, where the salesperson serves as an expert on problem recognition and resolution. This may take the form of <strong>upselling</strong> (introducing a higher-end product solution) or <strong>cross-selling</strong> (offering related or complementary products).</li>
</ol>

    <li><em>Deliver the presentation's content</em> – This is the point at which the salesperson makes the actual sales presentation. It is often useful to actually demonstrate the product, if applicable—either virtually (through the use of technology) or by actually bringing the product into the office.</li>
    
    <li><em>Handle any objections</em> – Objections are simply issues, questions, or concerns that the prospect raises as the salesperson makes the pitch. The salesperson has to be able to handle these types of comments quickly. The 6 most common responses to objections are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Acknowledge the objection and convert it to something good.</em> "It's expensive because it's made of the finest materials!"</li>
            <li><em>Postpone.</em> "I'll get to that later."</li>
            <li><em>Agree and neutralize.</em> "That's true, but the other benefits outweigh that problem."</li>
            <li><em>Accept the objection.</em> If the objection is valid, acknowledge it.</li>
            <li><em>Denial.</em> Deny the assertion when the objection is untrue or misleading.</li>
            <li><em>Ignore the objection.</em> If it appears that the prospect is stalling, just get on with the presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Handling objections professionally takes practice and skill. A salesperson should always handle objections ethically; lies and misrepresentations are never appropriate.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
    <li>The <strong>close</strong> is the end of the sales call, during which the salesperson summarizes the benefits, asks for the sale, confirms the sale, and thanks the customer. At the closing stage, the salesperson gets a purchase commitment from the prospect. This is the most important (and most difficult) stage. Three closing techniques are as follows:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Trial close</em> – Ask the prospect to decide on one aspect of the purchase. ("Do you want blue or green?")</li>
            <li><em>Assumptive close</em> – Ask the prospect to consider delivery, warranty, or financing options, assuming that a sale will be made.</li>
            <li><em>Urgency close</em> – Make reference to the timeliness of the purchase. ("The sale ends next week.")</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>After asking for the sale, a good salesperson is sure to show his or her appreciation for the sale with a "thank you."</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>The <strong>follow-up</strong> includes making sure the customer's purchase has been properly delivered and installed, and that any difficulties experienced with the use of the item are addressed. Salespeople don't simply make the sale and leave; they want to make sure that the sale could lead to possible future sales. Paying attention to this stage reinforces the buyer-seller relationship. This is particularly important in business-to-business transactions.
        
        <p>The follow-up can also be a good opportunity for a salesperson to pursue add-on sales (i.e., try to sell more to the customer). Most importantly, the follow-up plays an important role in building and sustaining a long-term relationship with customers. In the modern approach to selling, salespeople have increasingly embraced the importance of long-term relationships.</p>

<h2>Additional Sales-Related Concepts</h2>

<p>Now, we'll discuss a couple of additional closely related concepts.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Relationship selling</strong> is an approach that involves the following:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Listening</em> – You are much more likely to have a long-term relationship with someone who actually listens to you when you talk. Moreover, you can't serve customers well if you don't give them an opportunity to communicate their wants and needs. This shows the significance of the adaptive selling format.</li>
            
            <li><em>Expressing genuine concern for the customer</em> – Good salespeople recognize that their success depends on the customer's success. A good salesperson genuinely wants to help the customer fulfill a need or make an improvement.</li>
            
            <li><em>Keeping promises</em> – If a salesperson makes a promise, he or she works hard to make sure that it comes true. This is why follow-up is so important. With relationship selling, salespeople create long-term customers by establishing mutual respect and trust between buyers and sellers.</li>
            
            <li><em>Using industry and company knowledge to help meet the consumer's needs</em> – Customer relationship management is about giving value to a customer in a way that will make them want to keep coming back to you. A salesperson exists at the nexus between the selling organization and the buying organization; salespeople are compensated by the selling organization but also want the buying organization to succeed. As a relationship salesperson, you are essentially working for both organizations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Joint value creation (JVC)</strong> occurs when two companies work together. Joint value creation requires the selling firm to work closely with the buyer to find ways to help it create value for its customers. This can involve sharing customer knowledge, competitive intelligence, and company information for mutual benefit. A concept related to JVC is <strong>partnership selling</strong>, a type of relationship selling in which buyers and sellers work together to create customized solutions that work well for both of them.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Sales Force Management</h1>

<p>The <strong>sales force management process</strong> consists of three interrelated functions: (1) sales plan formulation, (2) sales plan implementation, and (3) evaluation and control of the sales force.</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Sales plan formulation</b> – A <strong>sales plan</strong> is a statement that describes in detail what is to be achieved and how the selling efforts of salespeople will be deployed. Formulating the sales plan involves the following tasks:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Setting sales objectives</em> – Sales objectives, which are objectively measurable goals, are typically set by top management and should be in accord with the company's IMC promotional campaigns. Objectives for each salesperson and the entire sales force must be set in terms of volume, new customers, sales calls, selling expenses, product knowledge, and customer service. These objectives need to be specific and measurable, specifying the time period over which they are to be achieved.</li>
            
            <li><em>Make or buy decision</em> – The company must decide whether to make or buy its selling functions such as leads and sales staff. This decision may be influenced by a competitors' decision to make or buy, as well as the industry.
                
                <p>Whether to use a company's own sales force or independent agents is determined with a combination of economics and behavioral analysis. Economics looks at the total costs of company salespeople, which include a total fixed cost for sales administration costs plus a percentage commission on sales, the unknown variable (X). Then, the total costs of company salespeople are set equal to the total costs of independent agents.</p>
                
                <p>In the example given in the book, fixed costs were $500,000, and in-house salespeople would be paid a 3% commission. Alternatively, the firm could hire independent agents at a 5% commission. The math goes like this:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <p>\(\text{Costs of company salespeople} = \text{Costs of independent agents}\)<br>
                \(\$500,000 + 0.03(X) = 0.05X\) (where \(X\) is the total sales volume)<br>
                \(\$500,000 = 0.05X - 0.03X\)<br>
                \(\$500,000 = 0.02X\)<br>
                \(X = \$500,000 \div 0.02 = \$25 \text{ million}\)</p>
                </ul>

                <p>In this example, if sales are above $25 million, it would make sense to use company salespeople. For sales below $25 million, it would make economic sense to use independent agents.</p>
                
                <p>However, economics will not answer this question entirely. Behavioral analysis considers control, flexibility, effort, and availability of both kinds of salespeople. These pros and cons must be weighed, along with the economic factors.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><em>Organization of the sales force</em> – In general, there are three ways in which a sales force can be organized.
                
                <ul>
                    <li><em>By region</em> – A salesperson might be assigned a specific geographical area. Each region might contain regional sales offices with multiple district sales offices. This is a common type of sales force organization, particularly for face-to-face selling, as it minimizes travel time and costs. A <em>geographical sales organization</em> is best when travel time, expenses, and selling effort duplication need to be minimized and the products or customers don't require specialized knowledge.</li>
                    
                    <li><em>By product line</em> – Specialized salespeople sell an entire product line to customers, regardless of their geographic location. A <em>product sales organization</em> is best when specific knowledge is required to sell certain kinds of products. This structure allows salespeople to develop specific expertise relating to certain products. This approach is costly and involves a lot of duplication of effort.
                        
                        <p>High-tech companies might use this form of sales force organization because their products are complicated, and salespeople need a lot of product knowledge. For example, network company Cisco used product-based organization for a long time, separating its sales staff into those selling router lines, those selling telephone lines, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li><em>By type of account</em> – Customer accounts can be classified according to any scheme the firm chooses and then assigned to particular salespeople or teams. A <em>customer sales organization</em> is best when different types of buyers have different needs. For example, financial services firms often separate business accounts from customer accounts because clients in these different groups have fundamentally different needs.
                        
                        <p>A variation of this structure is <strong>key account management</strong>—the practice of using team selling to focus on important customers to build mutually beneficial, long-term, cooperative relationships. Specific individuals are generally assigned to specific accounts, thus providing exceptional service to major customers.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>There is no one "best" structure; it depends largely on the situation. In fact, many firms change their sales organizations each year based on changes in marketing strategies.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><em>Determining the size of the sales force</em> – The sales plan should also indicate how many salespeople are necessary to achieve the company's sales goals. The <strong>workload method</strong> is the primary way of determining the appropriate size of the sales force. This method is valuable because it is flexible; it takes into account changes in most of the important variables that might affect the requisite size of the sales force. The workload method formula is as follows:
                
                \[
                NS = \frac{NC \times CF \times CL}{AST}
                \]
                
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <p>NS = Number of salespeople<br>
                    NC = Number of customers<br>
                    CF = Call frequency needed to service a customer yearly (# per year)<br>
                    CL = Length of average call (in hours)<br>
                    AST = Average amount of selling time available annually<br>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For example, assume a firm has 35,000 customers, each of whom it wants to call on 26 times per year for an average of 0.5 hours per call. Assuming 1,400 hours of selling time are available annually, the firm would need:</p>
                
                \[
                NS = \frac{NC \times CF \times CL}{AST} = \frac{35,000 \times 26 \times 0.5}{1,400} = 325 \text{ salespeople}
                \]
            </li>

            <li><em>Developing account management policies</em> – <strong>Account management policies</strong> specify whom salespeople should contact, what kinds of selling and customer service activities they should engage in, and how they should be carried out. The textbook presents an account management policy grid, which groups customers according to level of opportunity and the firm's competitive sales position. These policies must be developed as the third step in the sales plan formulation process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Sales plan implementation</b> – Plan formation focuses on "doing the right things;" plan implementation, on the other hand, focuses on "doing things right." Sales plan implementation involves the following steps:
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Recruiting</em> – Companies must recruit the right salespeople to form a qualified sales force that can competently carry out the sales plan.
                
                <p>Sales force recruitment and selection starts by forming a job analysis, job description, and a statement of job qualifications.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>job analysis</strong> describes the position and the tasks that make up the job.</li>
                    
                    <li>A <strong>job description</strong> describes job relationships and characterizes the position, indicating to whom the salesperson reports, how he or she interacts with other personnel, which customers he or she contacts, his or her specific activities, the job's demands, and the types of goods and services he or she will sell.</li>
                    
                    <li>This job description is turned into a <strong>statement of job qualifications</strong>, which indicate the skills, aptitudes, etc. that are required to perform the job.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Selling requires a high degree of <strong>emotional intelligence</strong>, the ability to understand one's own emotions and the emotions of people with whom one interacts on a daily basis. Firms evaluate potential salespeople through interviews, references, and application forms. Empathy, which is an important attitudinal aspect of sales and communicating with customers, is difficult to train; therefore, companies may use personality tests to screen for empathetic ability when recruiting salespeople.</p>
                
                <p>The sales force is becoming more diverse. Women make up half of the sales force, and the number of minorities is growing. Asian and Hispanic salespeople are the fastest-growing groups of salespeople today.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><em>Training the sales force</em> – Companies need to train salespeople to behave as desired. Salespeople must be given information both about how to make a sale and about the company's products. Salespeople typically spend a lot of time learning about the product before attempting to make a sale.
                
                <p>Sales force training should be an ongoing process for both new and experienced salespeople. This is an expensive process. On-the-job training and individual instruction by experienced salespeople are the two most popular kinds of training.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><em>Motivating</em> – Recognizing and compensating employees is important, and a firm should show appreciation to the sales force in order to keep them motivated. Opportunities for advancement within the company can also sometimes be an effective way to motivate salespeople. Additionally, nonmonetary rewards and incentives can be used to encourage salespeople to exceed their goals.
                
                <p>Properly compensating salespeople is important, if for no other reason but the fact that salesperson turnover is costly. It takes a lot of money to replace and train new salespeople. Companies have an interest in keeping their current salespeople satisfied.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><em>Compensation</em> – The sales force must be compensated appropriately. In general, there are three ways in which a sales force can be compensated:
                
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Straight salary</em> – A salesperson gets a fixed level of pay, which is not conditioned on how much he or she sells. This is easy to administer but offers little incentive to the salesperson. This is relatively uncommon in sales, but sometimes occurs for longer-term sales engineer positions. It is best when the salesperson does a lot of nonselling activities.</li>
                    
                    <li><em>Straight commission</em> – A salesperson gets a commission based on the sales or profits they generated (e.g., 1% of sales). This provides strong incentive to sell but may discourage quality customer service. This arrangement tends to be uncommon because it is difficult for people to make a living with such unstable income. This plan is best when few nonselling activities are performed.</li>
                    
                    <li><em>Combination compensation plans</em> – Two of the most common kinds of combination compensation plans are as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Salary plus commission</em> – The salesperson gets a baseline salary and an added commission based on their sales.</li>
                            <li><em>Salary plus bonus</em> – The salesperson gets a baseline salary, but the bonus is not tied to sales alone.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Sales plan evaluation and control</b> – This is the final function of the sales management process, and it involves evaluating and controlling the sales force. The company must be able to evaluate the sales force and separate good salespeople from bad salespeople to reward the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. Both quantitative and behavioral measures are used to tap different selling dimensions.
        
        <ul>
            <li><em>Quantitative assessments</em> – This compares actual output to the inputs that were outlined in the sales plan. Output measures often come in the form of a <strong>sales quota</strong>, specific goals assigned to a salesperson, team, branch sales office, or sales district for a stated time period.</li>
            
            <li><em>Behavioral evaluation</em> – These are more subjective evaluations of the salesperson, such as knowledge of the product, selling and communication skills, professionalism, appearance, attitude, and attention to customers. Customer satisfaction is a common measure of salesperson performance.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Firms increasingly use marketing dashboards to measure individual performance. For example, a marketing dashboard might display key numbers—such as sales revenue, gross margin, selling expense, profit, average order size, number of new customers, and customer satisfaction—for each salesperson. Both managers and salespeople would have access to these dashboards, which offer a quick assessment of each salesperson's performance.</p>
    </li>

<p>Two of the most common salesperson evaluation methods are conversion rate and meeting quota.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Conversion rate</b> – Conversion rate is a good measure for evaluating the performance of members of a large sales force.
        
        \[
        \text{Conversion Rate} = \frac{\text{# of Sales}}{\text{# of Calls}}
        \]
        
        <p>If you call on 30 people and make 3 sales, you have a conversion rate of 10%. A higher rate is better than a lower rate.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Meeting quota</b> – This technique evaluates the performance of a salesperson relative to the goals established by management. These goals are known as <em>sales quotas</em>.
        
        \[
        \text{Meeting Quota} = \frac{\text{\$ Actual Sales}}{\text{\$ Sales Goal}}
        \]
        
        <p>If the ratio is greater than one, actual sales have exceeded sales goals. If the ratio is less than one, actual sales have fallen short of sales goals. A higher ratio is better than a lower ratio.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Sales Force Automation and Customer Relationship Management</h2>

<p>Customer relationship management (CRM) systems and technologies have revolutionized personal selling and sales management. Three applications of CRM systems and technology are as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Sales force automation</em> – The most basic application of CRM systems and technologies is <strong>sales force automation (SFA)</strong>—the use of computer, information, communication, and internet technologies to make the sales function more effective and efficient. SFA can be applied to the sales force itself, as well as to each stage of the personal selling process. The goal of SFA is to free up time and allow salespeople to build relationships and provide service to customers. Laptops, notebooks, tablet computers, and other innovations have made the salesperson's job easier and more convenient. Salespeople can also give a multimedia computer presentation that brings potential customers a media-rich pitch for the product.</li>
    
    <li><em>Marketing automation</em> – Marketing automation is a more sophisticated application of CRM systems and technologies that provides salespeople with intelligence needed to do their jobs successfully. For example, these systems can qualify leads, track the customer buying process, and identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.</li>
    
    <li><em>Customer service and support automation</em> – Customer service and support automation provides customers with information about post-sale activities such as installation, repair, replacement, and replenishment. The goal is to provide customers the support that they need in order to avoid customer frustration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer relationship management promises productivity increases, improvements in customer relationships, and decreases in selling costs.</p>
